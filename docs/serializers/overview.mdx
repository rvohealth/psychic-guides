# Overview

Dream serializers provide a powerful and flexible way to shape your data for API responses and automatically generate corresponding OpenAPI documentation. The serializer DSL uses a fluent, programmatic API, making it dynamic and expressive when defining how your data is transformed.

At its core, a serializer in Dream takes an object (often a Dream model instance or a plain JavaScript object/[ViewModel](./view-models.mdx)) and defines how its properties should be transformed and which associated objects should be included in the output.

## Key Concepts

- **Fluent API**: Serializers are constructed by chaining methods like `.attribute()`, `.customAttribute()`, `.delegatedAttribute()`, `.rendersOne()`, and `.rendersMany()`.
- **`ObjectSerializer` and `DreamSerializer`**: These are the primary functions you'll use to initiate a serializer. `DreamSerializer` is typically used for Dream model instances, offering some model-specific conveniences, while `ObjectSerializer` is more generic and can be used for any JavaScript object, including ViewModels.
- **Explicit Definition**: You explicitly define what gets included and how it's transformed, giving you fine-grained control over the output.
- **OpenAPI Generation**: A key feature is the automatic generation of OpenAPI response schemas based on your serializer definitions. This helps keep your API documentation consistent with its implementation.
- **Flexibility**: You can define multiple serializers for the same model or object to cater to different use cases or endpoints (e.g., a `summary` view vs. a `detailed` view).
- **Synchronous by Design**: Dream serializers are intentionally synchronous. This design prevents accidental introduction of N+1 query problems or other unintended side effects (like external API calls) during the serialization phase itself. Any asynchronous data fetching or preparation should occur _before_ data is passed to the serializer. For complex asynchronous data preparation, consider using a [ViewModel](./view-models.mdx).

## Basic Structure

A typical serializer definition might look like this:

```typescript
// For a Dream Model instance (e.g., user loaded from DB)
import { DreamSerializer } from '@rvoh/dream'
import User from 'app/models/user' // Assuming User is a Dream model

const UserSerializer = (user: User) =>
  DreamSerializer(User, user)
    .attribute('id')
    .attribute('email')
    .attribute('name', {
      openapi: { description: 'The full name of the user' },
    })

// For a ViewModel or plain object
import { ObjectSerializer } from '@rvoh/dream'

interface UserViewModel {
  id: string
  fullName: string
  isActive: boolean
}

const UserViewModelSerializer = (userView: UserViewModel) =>
  ObjectSerializer(userView)
    .attribute('id')
    .attribute('fullName')
    .customAttribute(
      'status',
      () => (userView.isActive ? 'Active' : 'Inactive'),
      { openapi: 'string' }
    )
```
