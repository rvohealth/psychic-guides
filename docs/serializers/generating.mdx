# Generating Serializers

Dream provides two CLI commands for scaffolding models and their associated serializers:

- [generate:model](/docs/cli/generators/model)
- [generate:resource](/docs/cli/generators/resource)

The generated serializers are only intended as a starting point; they almost always need to be modified to return the shape of the data needed by a real world application.
