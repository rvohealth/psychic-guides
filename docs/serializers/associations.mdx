# associations

Like models, serializers also have a concept of association chaining, which allows you to express rich domains without getting tied in knots

```ts
import { Attribute, DreamSerializer } from '@rvohealth/dream'

export default class UserSerializer<
  DataType extends User,
> extends DreamSerializer<DataType> {
  @RendersMany(() => Pet)
  public pets: Pet[]
}
```

## renders many

## renders one
