# render

From within a controller, one can use a serializer to restrict attributes, like so:

```ts
  public myMethod() {
    const stuff = await Stuff.first()
    this.ok(new StuffSerializer(stuff).render())
  }
```

## implicit rendering

When a psychic controller receives either a dream model or an array of dream models as an argument to the `ok` method, it will automatically infer the serializer by calling the record(s) serializer. This means that, given a model with a serializer getter established (like so:)

```ts
class Stuff extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  public get serializers() {
    return {
      default: 'StuffSerializer',
      summary: 'StuffSummarySerializer',
    }
  }
}
```

The controller will implicitly render the model using it's `summary` serializer.

```ts
  public myMethod() {
    const stuffs = await Stuff.all()
    this.ok(stuffs, { serializer: 'summary' })
  }
```
