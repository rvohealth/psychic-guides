# DateTime

Datetime fields in the database are returned as DateTime objects. DateTime provides robust handling of datetimes, including timezone manipulation, formatting, and math. See [https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) for full documentation.

Note: in Psychic Projects, import DateTime from @rvoh/dream and do not include @types/luxon in your package.json. We found Luxon types to be incompatible with node16 module resolution and included modified DateTime types within Dream.

```ts
import { DateTime } from 'luxon'

DateTime.now()
DateTime.fromISO('2024-05-05T17:53:07.397Z')
```
