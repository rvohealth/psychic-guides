# DateTime

:::danger Avoid JavaScript's Date Class
**Never use JavaScript's native `Date` class in Psychic applications.** Always use Dream's `DateTime` for timestamps and `CalendarDate` for dates. JavaScript's `Date` has numerous timezone and parsing issues that can cause subtle bugs. Dream's classes provide built-in math, formatting, and robust timezone handling.

```ts
// ❌ DON'T DO THIS
const badDate = new Date()
const badParsed = new Date('2024-01-15')

// ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD - Built-in math and formatting
import { DateTime, CalendarDate } from '@rvoh/dream'
const goodDateTime = DateTime.now()
const goodDate = CalendarDate.today()
const formatted = goodDateTime.toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm')
const tomorrow = goodDate.plus({ days: 1 })
```

:::

Database `timestamp` columns are automatically loaded into DateTime objects when querying Dream models. DateTime provides robust handling of datetimes, including timezone manipulation, formatting, and math. See [https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) for full documentation.

Note: in Psychic Projects, import DateTime from @rvoh/dream and do not include @types/luxon in your package.json. We found Luxon types to be incompatible with node16 module resolution and included modified DateTime types within Dream.

```ts
import { DateTime } from 'luxon'

DateTime.now()
DateTime.fromISO('2024-05-05T17:53:07.397Z')
```
