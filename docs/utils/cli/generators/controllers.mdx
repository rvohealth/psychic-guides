# generating controllers

To generate a controller, you can use the `g:controller` cli command, like so:

```bash
yarn psy g:controller api/v1/users  create update destroy
```

If you are looking to generate both a model and a controller for that model, you can use the `g:resource` cli command, which will produce the model, a migration, a factory, boilerplate tests, a controller, and an entry in the routes.ts file.

```bash
yarn psy g:resource api/v1/users User email:string
```
