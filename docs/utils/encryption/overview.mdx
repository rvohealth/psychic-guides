# Overview

A light-weight `Encrypt` class is provided by `Dream`, which can be freely utilized throughout your app for symmetrical encryption tasks.

## Algorithms

By default, the `Encrypt` class only supports `AES-GCM` algorithms (meaning `aes-256-gcm`, `aes-192-gcm`, and `aes-128-gcm`), since the `gcm` is considered to be the most widely-used and secure modern encryption standard.

provide the algorithm you wish to use as the second argument to `.encrypt` or `.decrypt`, like so:

```ts
const encrypted = Encrypt.encrypt('helloworld', {
  algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
  key: process.env.APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY!,
})

const decrypted = Encrypt.decrypt(encrypted, {
  algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
  key: process.env.APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY!,
})

console.log(decrypted)
// 'helloworld'
```

## Keys

Encryption keys are an essential part of any encryption algorithm, and _must_ be provided in specific formats to be considered valid for a given encryption algorithm. For example, for `aes-256-gcm`, a 32 bit encryption key must be provided in base64 encoding. The list of requirements is as follows:

- `aes-256-gcm`: 32-bit, base64-encoded string
- `aes-192-gcm`: 24-bit, base64-encoded string
- `aes-128-gcm`: 16-bit, base64-encoded string

### Generating keys

Luckily, Dream handles the complexity of figuring out how to generate keys for your application for you. To generate a key, simply open your console and generate them with the `.generateKey` method, passing the algorithm you wish to use, like so:

```ts
NODE_ENV=development yarn console
> Encrypt.generateKey('aes-256-gcm')
// '65ogKxacRKyNxj20PCQKuBnxKgOty5eQnY4Ktbk04U0='
```

:::warning
Do _not_ hard-code this encryption key into your application! Always use either env vars, or, better yet, A tool like AWS SecretsManager to pull in your env vars at runtime.
