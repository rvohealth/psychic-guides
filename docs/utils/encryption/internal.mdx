# Internal

Psychic and Dream both use the `Encrypt` class under the hood for various operations. Configurations for these internal uses are provided in the `conf/app.ts` and `conf/dream.ts` files.

## Cookie encryption

By default, Psychic encrypts any cookies that are created through its cookie api. The encryption algorithm and key for this can be set in `conf/app.ts`, like so:

```ts
// conf/app.ts
psy.set('encryption', {
  cookies: {
    current: {
      algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
      key: process.env.APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY!,
    },
  },
})
```

If you are in the middle of key rotation and need to temporarily provide multiple keys for decryption, you can do that as well:

```ts
// conf/app.ts
psy.set('encryption', {
  cookies: {
    current: {
      algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
      key: process.env.APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY!,
    },
    legacy: {
      algorithm: 'aes-128-gcm',
      key: process.env.APP_LEGACY_ENCRYPTION_KEY!,
    },
  },
})
```

## Encrypted decorator

Within Dream, an `Encrypted` decorator is provided, which will automatically encrypt any values that are bound to its call. In order for it to work properly, you must provide an algorithm and key in the `conf/dream.ts` file, like so:

```ts
// conf/dream.ts
dream.set('encryption', {
  columns: {
    current: {
      algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
      key: process.env.APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY!,
    },
  },
})
```

If you are in the middle of key rotation and need to temporarily provide multiple keys for decryption, you can do that as well:

```ts
// conf/app.ts
dream.set('encryption', {
  columns: {
    current: {
      algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
      key: process.env.APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY!,
    },
    legacy: {
      algorithm: 'aes-128-gcm',
      key: process.env.APP_LEGACY_ENCRYPTION_KEY!,
    },
  },
})
```
