# i18n - overview

When designing an application, you will often find a need to have a translation layer within your app, where text that is delivered to your user can be carefully translated based on their preferred language. Since this need is very common, Psychic provides a very light-weight, typescript-forward translation engine for delivering multiple translations from your app.

```ts
const text = i18n('en-US', 'labels.nutrition.calories')
```
