# i18n - config

By default, Psychic apps are already provisioned with the necessary bindings to provide this translation utility. While the `i18n` function itself exists in the `app/helpers` folder, the configuration for it can be found at `conf/locales/index.ts`. By default, an english translation file is set up for you, but any other languages you wish to support can be provided as well.

```ts
// conf/locales/index.ts

import en from './en'
import es from './es'

export default {
  en,
  es,
}

export type SupportedLocales = 'en' | 'es'
```

Within each translation file, you will want to make sure to provide the same payload shape, so that translations can be correctly resolved in all locales:

```ts
// conf/locales/en.ts

export default {
  labels: {
    nutrition: {
      calories: 'calories',
    },
  },
}

// conf/locales/es.ts

export default {
  labels: {
    nutrition: {
      calories: 'calorias',
    },
  },
}
```

## Regional locale resolution

While our configurations demonstrate base locales like `en` and `es`, Psychic also supports more specific locale resolutions, such as `en-US` vs `en-UK`. To create locales which can resolve to these specific regions, you can simply provide direct overrides for each region, like so:

```ts
// conf/locales/index.ts

import en from './en'
import enUk from './en-UK'

export default {
  en,
  ['en-UK']: enUk,
}

export type SupportedLocales = 'en' | 'en-US' | 'en-UK'
```

With this in place, Psychic will carefully resolve the `en-UK` locale to the provided override. All other variants of `en-*` will be resolved to `en`.
