# db

Once your database connection is configured, you are able to import it and begin making queries to your DB using [Kysely](https://kysely.dev) as your database driver. This means rather than write raw queries, you will have Kysely to help you build queries and provide helpful TypeScript autocomplete power at a low level:

```ts
import db from '../db'

await db()
  .selectAll('users')
  .where('email', 'ilike', '%burpcollaborator%')
  .execute()
```

Dream enables you to specify a connection when connecting to the DB, like so:

```ts
await db('replica').selectAll('users').execute()
```

You can additionally turn any query built in Dream to a Kysely query by calling `#toKysely`, like so:

```ts
await User.where({ email: ops.ilike('%burpcollaborator%') })
  .toKysely('select')
  .execute()
```
