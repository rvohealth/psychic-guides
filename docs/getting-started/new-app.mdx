# new app

Once the [psychic cli is installed globally](/docs/installation), you can use it to create a new psychic app locally. To
do so, open your terminal and type the following in a directory of your choosing:

```bash
psy new myapp
```

Doing this will initiate a series of prompts for you to answer, each of which can be bypassed by providing the following options explicitly:

Options for the new api:

```bash
psy new --help
Usage: main new [options] <name>

create a new psychic app

Arguments:
  name          name of the app you want to create

Options:
  --redis       allow redis (i.e. --redis, or --redis false). If you don't set this, you will be prompted on whether or not to enable this.
  --ws          allow websockets (i.e. --ws, or --ws false) If you don't set this, you will be prompted on whether or not to enable this. Only
                enable this if redis is also enabled
  --primaryKey  the type of primary key to use. valid options are: 'bigserial', 'bigint', 'integer', 'uuid' (i.e. --primaryKey uuid)
  --client      the type of client to use. valid options are: 'react', 'vue', 'nuxt', 'none' (i.e. --client none)
  -h, --help    display help for command
```

Once the app has been generated, open your .env and .env.test files and make sure the `DB_USER` is filled in with the proper user for postgres (usually this is just the current username on your machine, which can be determined by running `whoami` from your terminal)

```bash
# myapp/api/.env

DB_USER=YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
DB_NAME=myapp_development
...etc
```

```bash
# myapp/api/.env.test

DB_USER=YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
DB_NAME=myapp_test
...etc
```

Once this is done, you are able to run a host of commands to play with your environment.

```bash
# create your database
psy db:create
NODE_ENV=test psy db:create

# migrate your database
psy db:migrate
NODE_ENV=test psy db:migrate

# start your dev server
psy dev

# run unit specs
psy uspec

# run feature specs
psy fspec

# open a repl with access to your model layer
psy console
```

For a guide to next steps, see [the authentication guide](/docs/getting-started/authenticating), which will guide you through generating a user model, establishing a basic authentication paradigm, and integrating a client.
