# new app

Once the psychic cli is installed globally, you can use it to create a new psychic app locally. To
do so, open your terminal and type the following in a directory of your choosing:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="basic" label="basic" default>
    ```bash
    cd ~/Sites # or another folder of your choosing

    # provision a new psychic app with:
    #   * no redis bindings
    #   * no websocket bindings
    #   * a new psychic backend (built on express) serving as a JSON api delivery system
    #   * a new react frontend to connect to your backend
    #   * a ts-jest testing integration plugged into your psychic server to run unit tests against your endpoints
    #   * a jest-puppeteer testing integration support to allow you to drive end-to-end specs that run accross your
    #   *   front end.
    psy new myapp
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="api-only" label="api-only">
    ```bash
    cd ~/Sites # or another folder of your choosing

    # provision a new psychic app with:
    #   * no redis bindings
    #   * no websocket bindings
    #   * no client app
    #   * a new psychic backend (built on express) serving as a JSON api delivery system
    #   * a ts-jest testing integration plugged into your psychic server to run unit tests against your endpoints
    psy new myapp --api
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ws" label="ws">
    ```bash
    cd ~/Sites # or another folder of your choosing

    # provision a new psychic app with websockets enabled.
    # this will enable websockets using the socket.io package.
    psy new myapp --ws
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="redis" label="redis">
    ```bash
    cd ~/Sites # or another folder of your choosing

    # provision a new psychic app with redis enabled.
    # this will create automatic bindings via the node-redis
    # package.
    psy new myapp --redis
    ```

  </TabItem>
