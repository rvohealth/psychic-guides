# new controller

To create a new controller, simply use the psychic cli. In addition to a controller name, you can pass methods to your controller to have the generator pre-fill them for you.

```bash
$ yarn psy g:controller todos helloworld create update
```

Once this is done, a new controller will appear with some methods prefilled for us.

```ts
// app/controllers/todos.ts

import { PsychicController, Params } from "psychic"

export default class TodosController extends PsychicController {
  public async helloworld() {}

  public async create() {}

  public async update() {}
}
```

Let's add a handler to our helloworld method to send some content out.

```ts
// app/controllers/todos.ts

...
public async helloworld() {
this.ok('helloworld!')
}
...
```
