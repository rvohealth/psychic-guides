# env

After creating a new app, you should first make sure to configure your environment and get your database set up. To use psychic, you must first have postgresql installed and running on your local machine.

Once you have postgres installed, open your .env and .env.test files. Your .env file sets environment variables for your development server, as well as for when you run the console, while your .env.test file sets env variables for jest, both when running unit and feature specs.

```bash
# .env
DB_USER=mypostgresuser
DB_NAME=myapp_development
DB_PORT=5432
DB_HOST=localhost
APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY='sp4-pki-dftx-nsbv7-sjgd7-ksnc-a7n2'

# .env.test
DB_USER=mypostgresuser
DB_NAME=myapp_test
DB_PORT=5432
DB_HOST=localhost
APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY='3gy-vg7-fd68-skndn-1u2vv-dknaaao-is'
```

Once this is done, you are able to run a host of commands to play with your environment.

```bash
# create your database
psy db:create
NODE_ENV=test psy db:create

# migrate your database
psy db:migrate
NODE_ENV=test psy db:migrate

# start your dev server
psy dev

# run unit specs
psy uspec

# run feature specs
psy fspec

# open a repl with access to your model layer
psy console
```
