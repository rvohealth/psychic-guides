# installation

In order to get started with psychic, you will first need to download the&nbsp;
[psychic cli](https://github.com/@rvohealth/psychic-cli"). This package is
really only needed to get a new app up and running. Once it is, you will use yarn scripts to
access the psychic cli, which will be useful for running migrations, generating resources,
starting your development server, etc...

```bash
yarn global add https://github.com/@rvohealth/psychic-cli
```
