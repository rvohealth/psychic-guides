Psychic and Dream were both built with the philosophy that major api changes should never happen. With that in mind, we have built our app to modern esmodules standards, and moved away from all legacy decorator proposals, since they are not compatible with pure esmodules, prior to open sourcing, so that we do not have to worry about back-supporting commonjs for legacy apps.

Upon open sourcing, we plan to focus on tidying up our code, responding to any security alerts, and building minor new functionality into our app where we see fit. The apis shifted a bit over time for our apps, especially as we began to encounter circular dependency nightmares as the app domains increased in complexity, and we have landed on apis that are not likely to shift around much anymore.

In terms of immediate post-launch priorities, and in addition to promptly responding to security concerns, we will be focused on the following initiatives:

- Fleshing out more functionality within our [psychic-websockets](https://github.com/rvohealth/psychic-websockets) and [psychic-workers](https://github.com/rvohealth/psychic-workers) repositories.
- Finding unique ways to enhance our plugin ecosystem and empower others
- iron out the rough kinks and missing features in our OpenAPI integration
- integrating with the open source community and identifying strong collaboration partners to help drive the future vision of this project
- Cleaning up our code. I hope you will have some patience, much of it was written too quickly on heavy time constraints, but once we have the breathing room, some cleanup is definitely in order.
- Improving documentation and guides
- Providing vscode and vim tools for enhancing app development experience
- enhancing spec helpers

For those looking to collaborate, we strongly encourage it! Please see our [contributing](/docs/contributing/contributing) guides for more information on how to do this.
