## Dream setup

In order to get started working on dream locally, you will first need to install the following:

- nodejs >= 23.9.0
- postgres >= 13.4
- redis >= 7.2.0 (if using workers or websockets)

Once done, you can clone the repo locally:

```bash
git clone https://rvohealth/dream
```

once in, you will need to add two env files:

```
# .env

DB_USER=WHO_AM_I
DB_PORT=5432
DB_HOST=localhost
PRIMARY_DB_NAME=dream_core_development
PRIMARY_DB_HOST=localhost
REPLICA_DB_NAME=dream_core_development
REPLICA_DB_HOST=localhost
APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="65ogKxacRKyNxj20PCQKuBnxKgOty5eQnY4Ktbk04U0="
LEGACY_APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="rulSOruUpfq6hqRezhK6l0tzhJtAE9SHxmubD9zIpaM="
```

```
# .env.test

DB_USER=WHO_AM_I
DB_PORT=5432
DB_HOST=localhost
PRIMARY_DB_NAME=dream_core_test
PRIMARY_DB_HOST=localhost
REPLICA_DB_NAME=dream_core_test
REPLICA_DB_HOST=localhost
APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="65ogKxacRKyNxj20PCQKuBnxKgOty5eQnY4Ktbk04U0="
LEGACY_APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="rulSOruUpfq6hqRezhK6l0tzhJtAE9SHxmubD9zIpaM="
```

In each of these files, you will want to replace `WHO_AM_I` with the result of running `whoami` in your local terminal. Generally speaking, the username for postgres will be the name of the current user, though this can be different depending on how postgres was installed.

Once this is done, you should be able to reset the test database and run specs:

```bash
yarn dreamcore db:reset
yarn spec
```
