# Usage

To use `Snapshotable`, first make sure to install the package

```sh
yarn add @rvohealth/dream-plugin-json-snapshot
```

Once done, find the model you want to take snapshots with, and be sure to extend the parent model using the provided mixin:

```ts
import { Snapshotable } from '@rvohealth/dream-plugin-json-snapshot'

class User extends Snapshotable(ApplicationModel) {
  ...
}
```

Once done, you can take a snapshot of a user like so:

```ts
const user = await User.firstOrFail()
const data = await user.takeSnapshot()
```

## Filtering out unwanted associations

In some cases, you want to hide certain associations from snapshots. In these cases, you can use the provided `HideFromSnapshotable` decorator, like so:

```ts
class User extends Snapshotable(ApplicationModel) {
  @HideFromSnapshotable()
  @User.HasMany(Pet)
  public pets: Pet[]
}
```
