# Usage

To use `Snapshotable`, first make sure to install the package

```sh
yarn add @rvoh/dream-plugin-json-snapshot
```

Once done, find the model you want to take snapshots with, and be sure to extend the parent model using the provided mixin:

```ts
import { Snapshotable } from '@rvoh/dream-plugin-json-snapshot'

class User extends Snapshotable(ApplicationModel) {
  ...
}
```

Once done, you can take a snapshot of a user like so:

```ts
const user = await User.firstOrFail()
const data = await user.takeSnapshot()
```

## Including `through` associations

`BelongsTo` associations are intentionally skipped, as are `through` associations, so Snapshotable automatically avoids circuits (which would lead to an infinite loop). To explicitly include a `through` association, decorate it with the `@SnapshotableFollowThrough()` decorator.

```ts
const deco = new Decorators<InstanceType<typeof Host>>()

export default class Host extends ApplicationModel {
  @deco.HasMany('HostPlace')
  public hostPlaces: HostPlace[]

  @SnapshotableFollowThrough()
  @deco.HasMany('Place', { through: 'hostPlaces' })
  public places: Place[]
}
```

## Filtering out unwanted associations

In some cases, you want to hide certain associations from snapshots. In these cases, you can use the provided `SnapshotableIgnore` decorator, like so:

```ts
class User extends Snapshotable(ApplicationModel) {
  @SnapshotableIgnore()
  @deco.HasMany(Pet)
  public pets: Pet[]
}
```
