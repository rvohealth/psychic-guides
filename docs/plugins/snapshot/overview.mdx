# Snapshotable - overview

Snapshotable provides a method, `takeSnapshot`, which will scan through each of your `HasMany` and `HasOne` associations, recursively following the chain all the way down and building up a json snapshot of each of the models found. This is useful in cases, say, where you need to backup all of a user's data to stay in compliance with HIPAA, or some other regulatory requirement.

:::tip

- To learn how to install and configure Snapshotable, see our [usage](/docs/plugins/snapshot/usage) guide.
