# Config

## Installation

There are two ways to install the `psychic-websockets` package. The first is by selecting `yes` when prompted during the initial psychic app provisioning stage. If you select yes, the package will be automatically installed, and your app bootstrapped to use websockets automatically.

However, if this is not the case for you and you are looking to install websockets after the fact, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the package.

```bash
yarn add @rvoh/psychic-websockets
```

2. Add the missing configuration file to `src/conf/websockets.ts`:

```ts
import { Encrypt } from '@rvoh/dream'
import { PsychicAppWebsockets, Ws } from '@rvoh/psychic-websockets'
import Redis from 'ioredis'

export default (wsApp: PsychicAppWebsockets) => {
  wsApp.set('websockets', {
    connection: new Redis({
      username: process.env.REDIS_USER,
      password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
      host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
      port: process.env.REDIS_PORT ? Number(process.env.REDIS_PORT) : undefined,
      tls: process.env.REDIS_USE_SSL === '1' ? {} : undefined,
      maxRetriesPerRequest: null,
    }),
  })

  wsApp.on('ws:start', (io) => {
    // do something on start
  })

  wsApp.on('ws:connect', () => {
    // do something once the initial socket.io connection is established.
    // this would be similar to calling io.on('connect', cb), which
    // you can also do.
  })
}
```

3. Update your `initializePsychicApp.ts` file to include the following:

```ts
import { PsychicApp, PsychicAppInitOptions } from '@rvoh/psychic'
import { PsychicAppWebsockets } from '@rvoh/psychic-websockets'
import psychicConf from '../../conf/app'
import dreamConf from '../../conf/dream'
import websocketsConf from '../../conf/websockets'

export default async function initializePsychicApp(
  opts: PsychicAppInitOptions = {}
) {
  const psychicApp = await PsychicApp.init(psychicConf, dreamConf, opts)
  await PsychicAppWebsockets.init(psychicApp, websocketsConf)
  // ...
  return psychicApp
}
```

4. We recommend you include a singleton within your application to simplify your websockets integration:

```ts
import { Ws } from '@rvoh/psychic-websockets'

export const WS_ROUTES = ['/ops/connection-success'] as const

const ws = new Ws(WS_ROUTES)

export default ws
```

## Configuration

The configuration for the `psychic-websockets` package is driven by the `conf/websockets.ts` file. This file contains both basic bootstrapping information for redis, as well as hooks to tap into to initialize socket.io and establish websocket listeners for your backend application.

### Redis

Redis, which is used to emit accross distributed websocket systems, can be configured using the `#set` method provided by `PsychicAppWebsockets`, like so:

```ts
import { Encrypt } from '@rvoh/dream'
import { PsychicAppWebsockets, Ws } from '@rvoh/psychic-websockets'
import Redis from 'ioredis'

export default (wsApp: PsychicAppWebsockets) => {
  wsApp.set('websockets', {
    connection: new Redis({
      username: process.env.REDIS_USER,
      password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
      host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
      port: process.env.REDIS_PORT ? Number(process.env.REDIS_PORT) : undefined,
      tls: process.env.REDIS_USE_SSL === '1' ? {} : undefined,
      maxRetriesPerRequest: null,
    }),
  })
}
```

### Hooks

In addition to configuration, psychic-websockets also exposes hooks to tap into during various lifecycle events exposed by the websockets app.

#### ws:start

The `ws:start` event is called whenever the psychic server is started. This allows you to establish socket bindings. Under the hood we are using [socket.io](https://socket.io) to power our websocket bindings, which means you can visit their documentation to understand more about setting up a websockets app within your application.

```ts
export default (wsApp: PsychicAppWebsockets) => {
  // ...
  wsApp.on('ws:start', (io) => {
    // use socket.io to establish namespaced channels
    // for your app to communicate on
    io.of('/').on('connection', async (socket) => {
      // this is an example of how you might be handling
      // socket.io authentication. It would require extra
      // setup on both your frontend and backend clients,
      // but would enable you to emit to any user from anywhere
      // within the application.
      const token = socket.handshake.auth.token as string
      const userId = Encrypt.decrypt<string>(token, {
        algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
        key: process.env.APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY!,
      })!
      const user = await User.find(userId)

      if (user) {
        // this automatically fires the /ops/connection-success message
        await Ws.register(socket, user.id)
      }

      // establish socket routes using socket.on
    })
  })
}
```
