ai_summary: Custom plugins can be built using app.plugin method (available on DreamApp and PsychicApp). Plugin functions are called after Psychic and Dream are initialized. Built-in plugins include workers, websockets (beta), and Snapshotable. Plugins extend app functionality similar to conf/app.ts and conf/dream.ts.

Building custom plugins in the Psychic ecosystem is incredibly simple. You can utilize the `app.plugin` method (this exists both on the `DreamApp` and `PsychicApp` classes) to register custom behavior, enabling you to provide encapsulated logic to extend both dream and psychic exactly the same way you would if you were writing custom code into the `conf/app.ts` and `conf/dream.ts` files directly.

```ts
// conf/app.ts
export default async (psy: PsychicApp) => {
  ...
  psy.plugin(myPlugin)
}

async function myPlugin(psy: PsychicApp) {
  // this function will be called after both Psychic and Dream
  // are initialized, enabling you to extend both with
  // custom behavior
}
```

Psychic also ships with a few helpful plugins that you can opt into during app provisioning. These are utilities that most applications may not need, but for the ones that do, they provide a powerful pack of extra features.

## Psychic workers

The [workers plugin](/docs/plugins/workers/overview) enables you to easily provision background job systems that integrate seamlessly into your app's service and model layers, enabling you to easily kick functions off to a background system whenever you see fit.

## Psychic websockets (beta)

The [websockets plugin](/docs/plugins/websockets/overview) provides mechanisms for leveraging redis pubsub mechanisms to bind socket.io to your app, enabling you to emit messages to your users no matter which web instance they are connected to.

## Snapshotable

The [Snapshotable plugin](/docs/plugins/snapshot/overview) plugin provides a powerful mixin to enable you to easily take snapshots of your model layer.
