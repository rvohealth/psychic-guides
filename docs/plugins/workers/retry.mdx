# Automatic retry of failed jobs

Jobs that throw an unhandled Error during execution are automatically retried. The [exponential backoff strategy](https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/retrying-failing-jobs#exponential) provided by BullMQ is configured by default via the `defaultBullMQQueueOptions` in `conf/initializers/workers.ts` and may be customized there as needed:

```ts
    defaultBullMQQueueOptions: {
      defaultJobOptions: {
        removeOnComplete: 1000,
        removeOnFail: 20000,
        // 524,288,000 ms (~6.1 days) using algorithm:
        // "2 ^ (attempts - 1) * delay"
        attempts: 20,
        backoff: {
          type: 'exponential',
          delay: 1000,
        },
      },
    },
```

This config is sent directly to BullMQ, so see [the BullMQ retry documentation](https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/retrying-failing-jobs) for details on how to customize the retry strategy.
