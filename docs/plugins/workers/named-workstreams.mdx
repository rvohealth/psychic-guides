# Named workstreams

Named workstreams isolate certain work within a dedicated BullMQ Queue. Not only does this enable control over resource allocation to certain work, but it organizes visualization when using a dashboard such as the [Taskforce BullMQ dashboard](https://taskforce.sh) or the open source [Express Bull Dashboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bull-board/express):

Configure named workstreams in `conf/workers.ts` by adding a `namedWorkstreams` key:

```ts
  workersApp.set('background', {
    ...

    namedWorkstreams: [
      {
        name: 'Iterable',
        // https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/parallelism-and-concurrency
        workerCount: 1,
        concurrency: 10,
      },
      {
        name: 'Twilio',
        // https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/parallelism-and-concurrency
        workerCount: 1,
        concurrency: 10,
      },
    ],
  })

  ...
})
```

Then set the workstream used by the class:

```ts
class IntercomSync extends ApplicationBackgroundedService {
  public static get backgroundJobConfig(): BackgroundJobConfig<ApplicationBackgroundedService> {
    return { workstream: 'Iterable' }
  }
}
```
