# Services

Any class that extends `ApplicationBackgroundedService` provides the `background` and `backgroundWithDelay` methods that are used to background methods on the class. For instance, let's say you have a service that syncs your user data to a service like intercom, twilio, salesforce, helpdesk, etc...

```ts
class IntercomSync {
  public static async syncUser(user: User) {
    // ...sync user to intercom
  }
}
```

You can easily make this a backgroundable service. Simply extend `ApplicationBackgroundedService`, and now you can background:

```ts
class IntercomSync extends ApplicationBackgroundedService {
  public static async syncUser(user: User) {
    await this.background('_syncUser', user.id)
  }

  public static async _syncUser(id: IdType) {
    const user = await User.find(id)
    if (!user) return
    // ...sync user to intercom
  }
}
```

Now, from anywhere in your app you can safely call `syncUser` without tying up resources on the api request!
