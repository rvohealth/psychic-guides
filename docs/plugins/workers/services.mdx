# ApplicationBackgroundedService

Within any class extending your `ApplicationBackgroundedService` class, you will find both static and instance `background` methods. These methods are used to execute underlying methods on your model in the background. For instance, let's say you have a service that syncs your user data to a service like intercom, twilio, salesforce, helpdesk, etc...

```ts
class IntercomSync {
  public static async syncUser(id: IdType) {
    // ...sync user to intercom
  }
}
```

You can easily make this a backgroundable service. Simply extend `ApplicationBackgroundedService`, and now you can background:

```ts
class IntercomSync extends ApplicationBackgroundedService {
  public static async syncUser(id: string) {
    await this.background('_syncUser', id)
  }

  public static async _syncUser(id: IdType) {
    // ...sync user to intercom
  }
}
```

Now, from anywhere in your app you can safely call `syncUser` without tying up resources on the api request!
