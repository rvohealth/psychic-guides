# Emitting

Once you have successfully built a registration flow for your users (see our [Registering guides](/docs/websockets/registering) if you have not), you are able to emit to those registered users anywhere in your application (yes, including within background jobs!).

To establish a new Ws instance, we need to provide it with a set of routes that our application allows, like so:

```ts
const wsRoutes = ['/users/ping', 'users/alert', 'users/info'] as const
ws = new Ws(wsRoutes)
```

For your convenience, we recommend that you set up a simple helper function in your application to wrap this, as well as to establish a singleton, so as to prevent multiple instances from needing to establish independent connections:

```ts
// app/helpers/ws.ts

import { Ws } from '@rvohealth/psychic'

let _ws: Ws

export default function appWs() {
  if (_ws) return _ws

  _ws = new Ws(wsRoutes)

  return _ws
}

export const wsRoutes = ['/users/ping', 'users/alert', 'users/info'] as const
```

Once this has been established, you can now emit to your users with any of the provided routes:

```ts
await appWs().emit(user, '/users/ping', { hello: 'world' })
```
