# REST verbs

You can add routes using the standard http methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. In the below example, all the different http verbs will be pointing to the ping controller's ping method.

```ts // conf/routes.ts
import { PsychicRouter } from 'psychic'
import PingController from '../app/controllers/PingController'

export default (r: PsychicRouter) => {
  r.get('/ping', PingController, 'ping')
  r.post('/ping', PingController, 'ping')
  r.put('/ping', PingController, 'ping')
  r.patch('/ping', PingController, 'ping')
  r.delete('/ping', PingController, 'ping')
}
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
GET     /ping  Ping#ping
POST    /ping  Ping#ping
PUT     /ping  Ping#ping
PATCH   /ping  Ping#ping
DELETE  /ping  Ping#ping
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

Whenever providing a top-level route, Psychic will not attempt to infer the controller name for you. This means that you are forced to explicitly provide a controller and action in these cases. Once providing a controller, typescript autocomplete helpers will aid you in selecting an action (i.e. a public method on your controller) to call when that route is hit.

## middleware

You can provide express middleware directly to a route by sending a callback function as the second argument to any method, i.e.

```ts
r.get('ping', (req, res, next) => {
  res.json({ hello: 'world' })
})
```
