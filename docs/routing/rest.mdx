ai_summary: REST verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) can be used to define routes. Top-level routes require explicit controller and action. Supports Express middleware as second argument or in array for multiple middleware.

# REST verbs

You can add routes using the standard HTTP methods, such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. In the below example, all the different HTTP verbs will be pointing to the ping controller's ping method:

```ts // conf/routes.ts
import { PsychicRouter } from 'psychic'
import PingController from '../app/controllers/PingController'

export default (r: PsychicRouter) => {
  r.get('/ping', PingController, 'ping')
  r.post('/ping', PingController, 'ping')
  r.put('/ping', PingController, 'ping')
  r.patch('/ping', PingController, 'ping')
  r.delete('/ping', PingController, 'ping')
}
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
GET     /ping  Ping#ping
POST    /ping  Ping#ping
PUT     /ping  Ping#ping
PATCH   /ping  Ping#ping
DELETE  /ping  Ping#ping
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

Whenever providing a top-level route, Psychic will not attempt to infer the controller name for you. This means that you are forced to explicitly provide a controller and action in these cases. Once providing a controller, TypeScript autocomplete helpers will aid you in selecting an action (i.e. a public method on your controller) to call when that route is hit.

## Middleware

You can provide Express middleware directly to a route by sending a callback function as the second argument to any method, i.e.:

```ts
r.get('ping', (req, res, next) => {
  res.json({ hello: 'world' })
})
```
