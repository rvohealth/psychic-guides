# overview

Routing enables your app to listen on specified routes, and to forward traffic from those routes to a controller and method of your choice. In the below example, a single route, `health-check`, will point to the `controllers/HealthCheckController.ts` file's `ping` method. 

<RightSidebarItem>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
GET     /health-check  HealthCheck#ping
`}
  </pre>
</RightSidebarItem>

```ts // conf/routes.ts
import { PsychicRouter } from 'psychic'

export default (r: PsychicRouter) => {
  r.get('/health-check', 'HealthCheck#ping')
}
```

Psychic also provides the ability to namespace routes, which can be done using a variety of [namespacing](/docs/routing/namespacing) techniques.
