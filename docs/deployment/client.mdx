# client

When provisioning your application, you may have decided to provision one or more client applications to run along side it. Each of these applications is likely a React or Vue application, or some other application. In any case, the client application builds are completely separated from server builds, allowing you to follow standard practices for deploying these client applications.

For this type of thing, we recommend using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com), though you could additionally use [heroku](https://www.heroku.com), or any other service that does this in a few clicks, or even just deploy to an s3 bucket and turn on static hosting.
