# belongs to associations

## Overview

Belongs to associations are to be used when the model in question is related to another model, and contains a foreign key to that model within its table. An example of a belongs to would be in the case of a `User` and `Post` model, where a `User` can write many `Post`s, and each `Post` would contain a field (called a foreign key) which points back to the `id` field of a `User` who owns it. In this context, we would say that the `Post` belongs to the `User`:

```ts
export default class Post extends Dream {
  ...
  @deco.BelongsTo('User')
  public user: User
  public userId: DreamColumn<User, 'userId'>
}
```

## Options

### optional

`BelongsTo` associations are required by default (and should have a corresponding not-null declaration on the foreign key column). To make an association optional, pass the `optional: true` option (and ensure that the column allows null values):

```ts
export default class Post extends Dream {
  ...
  @deco.BelongsTo('User', { optional: true })
  public user: User
  public userId: DreamColumn<User, 'userId'>
}
```

IMPORTANT: `optional` belongs-to associations do _not_ automatically result in `optional` `rendersOne` declarations in serializers. In cases when a serializer is rendering an optional belongs-to association on a Dream model, declare the rendersOne as optional (it is uncommon for model serializers to render belongs-to associations, so this is a rare requirement).

### Foreign key (on option)

By default, the foreign key is derived from the association name. E.g., in the example below, the default foreign key would be `userId`. This can be overridden by including an explicit `on: '<camelized-column-name-on-this-table>'` option:

```ts
export default class Post extends Dream {
  public get table() {
    return 'posts' as const
  }

  public id: number
  public content: string | null

  @deco.BelongsTo('User', { on: 'myUserId' })
  public user: User
  public myUserId: number
}
```

### Primary key override

By default, the column that the foreign key points to is returned by the `primaryKey` getter
(and defaults to `id`). For associations that point to something other than the primary key,
this can be overridden by passing the `primaryKeyOverride: '<column-name-on-target-table>'` option.

```ts
export default class Post extends Dream {
  public get table() {
    return 'posts' as const
  }

  public id: number
  public content: string | null

  @deco.BelongsTo('User', { primaryKeyOverride: 'uuid' })
  public user: User
  public userId: number
}
```
