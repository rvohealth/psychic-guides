# belongs to

Belongs to associations are to be used when the model in question is related to another model, and contains a foreign key to that model within its table. An example of a belongs to would be in the case of a `User` and `Post` model, where a `User` can write many `Post`s, and each `Post` would contain a field (called a foreign key) which points back to the id field of a `User` who owns it. In this context, we would say that the `Post` belongs to the `User`.

    export default class Post extends Dream {
      public readonly get table() {
        return 'posts' as const
      }

      public id: number
      public content: string | null

      @BelongsTo(() => User)
      public user: User
      public userId: number
    }

    ```

      public content: string | null

      // this expects the Post model to have a field 'myUserId',
      // which will point to the 'id' field on the User model
