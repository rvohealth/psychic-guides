# belongs to

Belongs to associations are to be used when the model in question is related to another model, and contains a foreign key to that model within its table. An example of a belongs to would be in the case of a `User` and `Post` model, where a `User` can write many `Post`s, and each `Post` would contain a field (called a foreign key) which points back to the id field of a `User` who owns it. In this context, we would say that the `Post` belongs to the `User`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="basic" label="basic" default>
    ```ts
    export default class Post extends Dream {
      public readonly get table() {
        return 'posts' as const
      }

      public id: number
      public content: string | null

      @BelongsTo(() => User)
      public user: User
      public userId: number
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="optional" label="optional" default>

    BelongsTo associations are required by default (and should have a corresponding
    not-null declaration on the foreign key column). To make an association optional,
    pass the `optional: true` option (and ensure that the column allows null values).

    ```ts
    export default class Post extends Dream {
      public readonly get table() {
        return 'posts' as const
      }

      public id: number
      public content: string | null

      @BelongsTo(() => User, { optional: true })
      public user: User
      public userId: number
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="foreign-key" label="foreign key">
    By default, the foreign key is derived from the association name. E.g., in the example below, the
    default foreign key would be `userId`. This can be overridden by including an explicit
    `foreignKey: '<camelized-column-name-on-this-table>'` option.

    ```ts
    export default class Post extends Dream {
      public readonly get table() {
        return 'posts' as const
      }

      public id: number
      public content: string | null

      @BelongsTo(() => User, { foreignKey: 'myUserId' })
      public user: User
      public myUserId: number
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="primary-key-override" label="primary key override">
    By default, the column that the foreign key points to is returned by the `primaryKey` getter
    (and defaults to `id`). For associations that point to something other than the primary key,
    this can be overridden by passing the `primaryKeyOverride: '<column-name-on-target-table>'` option.

    ```ts
    export default class Post extends Dream {
      public readonly get table() {
        return 'posts' as const
      }

      public id: number
      public content: string | null

      @BelongsTo(() => User, { primaryKeyOverride: 'uuid' })
      public user: User
      public userId: number
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
