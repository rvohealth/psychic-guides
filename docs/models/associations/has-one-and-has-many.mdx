ai_summary: HasOne and HasMany associations link a model to associated models where the foreign key is on the associated model. HasMany represents one-to-many relationships. HasOne represents one-to-one relationships. Options include foreignKey (on option), dependent (for cascading deletes), and through (for many-to-many via join table).

# has associations

## Overview

"Has" associations are associations in which the foreign key is located on the associated model, and are usually met on the other side with a `@BelongsTo` association. There are two types of "Has" associations supported by Dream:

- `HasMany` - one-to-many relationships
- `HasOne` - one-to-one relationships

## HasMany

In a HasMany relationship, your base model can potentially point to many different child relationships.

```ts
class User extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.HasMany('Pet')
  public pets: Pet[]
}

class Pet extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.BelongsTo('User')
  public user: User[]
  public userId: DreamColumn<Pet, 'userId'>
}
```

In the above example, we see that `Pet` has a `@BelongsTo` association pointing to `User`. This means that the `Pet` is able to belong to a single `User`, but a `User` can have many `Pet`s. This is established through the `userId` foreign key on the `Pet` model.

## HasOne

Complementary to `@HasMany`, we have the `@HasOne` association, which is almost identical to the `@HasMany`, except it should only be used in cases where you only plan on having one record attached:

```ts
class User extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.HasOne('UserSettings')
  public userSettings: UserSettings | null
}

class UserSettings extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.BelongsTo('User')
  public user: User[]
  public userId: DreamColumn<UserSettings, 'userId'>
}
```

In this case, we have an identical pattern established, except that we are using `@HasOne` in place of `@HasMany`, establishing that there will only be one `UserSettings` record for each `User` record.

## Options

### Foreign key (on option)

When defining a `HasOne`/`HasMany` association, the foreign key is automatically assumed to be the singularized (depluralized) version of the base model's table name. This means that for the following model, `userId` will be the expected foreign key on both `UserSettings` and `Pet` models:

```ts
class User extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.HasOne('UserSettings')
  public userSettings: UserSettings | null

  @deco.HasMany('Pet')
  public pets: Pet[]
}
```

To customize the foreign key, you can pass an additional `on` option to explicitly specify the foreign key, in the event that it does not line up neatly with the model's table name.

```ts
class User extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.HasOne('UserSettings', { on: 'userUuid' })
  public userSettings: UserSettings | null
}
```

### And

Sometimes it is necessary to further-narrow the scope of your association using ann `and` statement. This can be done by passing an additional `and` argument to your association, like so:

```ts
class User extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.HasOne('Pet', { and: { name: 'Aster' } })
  public favoritePet: Pet | null
}
```

> Note: when using an `and` clause to create a HasOne, make sure to add a unique index on the the foreign key column (and the foreign key type column if a polymorphic association) and the column(s) in the `and` clause. For example:

```ts
await db.schema.createIndex('pets_user_id_name').on('pets').columns(['user_id', 'name']).unique().execute()
```

In some cases, dynamic values will need to be permitted for the provided `and` statements. In these cases, you can leverage required `and` clauses to enforce the `and` clause to be present any time an association is loaded. If utilized, an exception will be raised if you attempt to load this association without passing the required `and` statements.

```ts
class User extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.HasOne('Pet', { and: { species: DreamConst.required } })
  public favoritePet: Pet | null
}

const user = await User
  .preload('favoritePet', { species: 'cat' })
  .firstOrFail()

user.favoritePet
// Pet{ species: 'cat' }
```

Additionally, you can defer the passed arguments to a higher level by leveraging our `passthrough` support, like so:

```ts
class User extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.HasOne('LocalizedText', { and: { locale: DreamConst.passthrough } })
  public currentLocalizedText: LocalizedText | null
}

const user = await User
  .passthrough({ locale: 'en-US' })
  .preload('currentLocalizedText')
  .firstOrFail()

user.currentLocalizedText
// LocalizedText{ locale: 'en-US' }
```

### AndNot

Similar to `and`, a `andNot` statement can be provided to filter records:

```ts
class User extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.HasMany('LocalizedText', { andNot: { deletedAt: null } })
  public deletedLocalizedTexts: LocalizedText[]
}
```

### AndAny

For and-ing with the result of an `or` statement:

```ts
class Balloon extends ApplicationModel {
  ...
  @deco.HasMany('Balloon', { andAny: [{ color: null }, { color: 'red' }] })
  public redOrColorlessBalloons: Balloon
}
```

### Order

When an association is defined with an `order`, that ordering is automatically applied whenever `loading` or [`preloading`](/docs/models/querying/preload) models. Association `order` supports the same options as query [`order`](/docs/models/querying/order).

```ts
export default class GraphNode extends ApplicationModel {
  // ...

  public name: string

  ///////////////////////////////////////////
  // order built into the join association //
  ///////////////////////////////////////////
  @deco.HasMany('EdgeNode', { on: 'nodeId', order: 'position' })
  public orderedEdgeNodes: EdgeNode[]

  @deco.HasMany('GraphEdge', { through: 'orderedEdgeNodes' })
  public edges: GraphEdge[]

  //////////////////////////////////////////////
  // order applied to the through association //
  //////////////////////////////////////////////
  @deco.HasMany('EdgeNode', { on: 'nodeId' })
  public edgeNodes: EdgeNode[]

  @deco.HasMany('GraphEdge', {
    through: 'edgeNodes',
    order: 'weight',
    source: 'edge', // since `edgesOrderedByWeight` does not correspond to an
    // association on EdgeNode, we explicitly specify the EdgeNode association
    // to use as the source of the models to instantiate
  })
  public edgesOrderedByWeight: GraphEdge[]
}

export default class EdgeNode extends ApplicationModel {
  // ...

  @deco.Sortable({ scope: 'node' })
  public position: DreamColumn<EdgeNode, 'position'>

  @deco.BelongsTo('GraphEdge', { on: 'edgeId' })
  public edge: GraphEdge
  public edgeId: DreamColumn<EdgeNode, 'edgeId'>

  @deco.BelongsTo('GraphNode', { on: 'nodeId' })
  public node: GraphNode
  public nodeId: DreamColumn<EdgeNode, 'nodeId'>
}

export default class GraphEdge extends ApplicationModel {
  // ...
  public weight: DreamColumn<GraphEdge, 'weight'>
}
```

### Dependent

In most cases, cascade deleting for associations can be set up at the database level by simply defining the relationship with a cascade option at the migration level, like so:

```ts
export async function up(db: Kysely<any>): Promise<void> {
  await db.schema
    .createTable('pets')
    ...
    .addColumn(
      'user_id',
      'bigint',
      col => col
        .references('users.id').onDelete('cascade')
    )
    ...
}
```

However, in the case of polymorphic relationships, this type of cascading is not possible, since the foreign key of a polymorphic association can point to many other tables. To fix this problem, you can set a `dependent` option at the association level, like so:

```ts
class Rating extends ApplicationModel {
  @deco.BelongsTo(['Composition', 'Post'], {
    polymorphic: true,
    dependent: 'destroy',
  })
  public rateable: Composition | Post
  public rateableId: DreamColumn<Rating, 'rateableId'>
  public rateableType: DreamColumn<Rating, 'rateableType'>
}
```

In the above example, any time a `Composition` or `Post` model is destroyed, cascade deletions will apply to any related ratings, causing them to be removed from the database.

### Distinct

If you want to avoid picking up duplicate records with the same value for a certain field, you can use the `distinct` argument to filter those duplicates out, like so:

```ts
class User extends ApplicationModel {
  @deco.HasMany('Pet', { distinct: 'name' })
  public petsWithUniqueNames: Pet[]
}
```

### PrimaryKeyOverride

In some cases, you may find it necessary to change the primary key being used on the base model when loading a HasOne/HasMany association. By default, dream will use the `id` field as the primary key of the model, but this can be customized on a per-association basis if needed using the `primaryKeyOverride` option:

```ts
class User extends ApplicationModel {
  @deco.HasMany('Pet', { primaryKeyOverride: 'uuid' })
  public pets: Pet[]
}
```

In the above example, any time the `pets` association is loaded, it will automatically compare the `userId` field on the `Pet` model to the `uuid` field on the `User` model.

### SelfAnd

`selfAnd` adds a `and` clause to an association between a column on the associated model and a column on this model.

For example, suppose we have an ArtExhibit, and that each day, we want to feature a different Artwork within that exhibit. Every day, we update the `featuredPosition` on the ArtExhibit. The `featuredArtwork` is the Artwork with that `position`.

```ts
const exhibits = await ArtExhibit.preload('featuredArtwork`).all()
// each exhibit now has its `featureArtwork` loaded and ready to serialize, etc.

export default class ArtExhibit extends ApplicationModel {
  // ...

  public featuredPosition: DreamColumn<ArtExhibit, 'featuredPosition'>

  @deco.HasMany('Artwork')
  public artworks: Artwork[]

  @deco.HasOne('Artwork', {
    selfAnd: {
      position: 'featuredPosition',
    },
  })
  public featuredArtwork: Artwork
}

export default class Artwork extends ApplicationModel {
  // ...

  @deco.Sortable({ scope: 'artExhibit' })
  public position: DreamColumn<Artwork, 'position'>

  @deco.BelongsTo('ArtExhibit')
  public artExhibit: ArtExhibit
  public artExhibitId: DreamColumn<Artwork, 'artExhibitId'>
}
```

### SelfAndNot

`selfAndNot` adds a `andNot` clause to an association between a column on the associated model and a column on this model.

For example, the below `siblings` association matches all EdgeNodes attached to the same GraphNode that are not the current EdgeNode:

```ts
const siblingEdgeNodes = await edgeNode.load('siblings').execute()
// siblingEdgeNodes is all of edgeNode's siblings

export default class EdgeNode extends ApplicationModel {
  // ...

  @deco.BelongsTo('GraphNode', { on: 'nodeId' })
  public node: DreamColumn<GraphNode, 'node'>
  public nodeId: DreamColumn<GraphNode, 'nodeId'>

  @deco.HasMany('EdgeNode', {
    through: 'node',
    source: 'edgeNodes',
    selfAndNot: { id: 'id' },
  })
  public siblings: EdgeNode[]
}

export default class GraphNode extends ApplicationModel {
  // ...

  @deco.HasMany('EdgeNode', { on: 'nodeId' })
  public edgeNodes: EdgeNode[]
}
```
