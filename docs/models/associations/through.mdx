# through

both HasOne and HasMany associations have recursively-nested `through` support built-in, allowing you to bring nested associations out of their nested context and into the parent model's domain.

```ts
export default class CommentReply extends Dream {
  public get table() {
    return 'comment_replies' as const
  }

  public id: number
  public content: string | null

  @BelongsTo(() => Comment)
  public comment: Comment

  @HasOne(() => User, { through: 'comment' })
  public user: User
}
```
