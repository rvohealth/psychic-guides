# selfWhere

`selfWhere` adds a `where` clause to an association between a column on the associated model and a column on this model.

For example, suppose we have an ArtExhibit, and that each day, we want to feature a different Artwork within that exhibit. Every day, we update the `featuredPosition` on the ArtExhibit. The `featuredArtwork` is the Artwork with that `position`.

```typescript
const exhibits = await ArtExhibit.preload('featuredArtwork`).all()
// each exhibit now has its `featureArtwork` loaded and ready to serialize, etc.

export default class ArtExhibit extends ApplicationModel {
  // ...

  public featuredPosition: DreamColumn<ArtExhibit, 'featuredPosition'>

  @HasMany(() => Artwork)
  public artworks: Artwork[]

  @HasOne(() => Artwork, {
    selfWhere: {
      position: 'featuredPosition',
    },
  })
  public featuredArtwork: Artwork
}

export default class Artwork extends ApplicationModel {
  // ...

  @Sortable({ scope: 'artExhibit' })
  public position: DreamColumn<Artwork, 'position'>

  @BelongsTo(() => ArtExhibit)
  public artExhibit: ArtExhibit
  public artExhibitId: DreamColumn<Artwork, 'artExhibitId'>
}
```
