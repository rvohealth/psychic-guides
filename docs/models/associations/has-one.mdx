# has one

Has one associations enable us to express a singular inverse of the belongs to statement. This means that if the `Post` class were to belong to `User`, then the user could potentially have one post (though they would more-than-likely have many instead).

```ts

export default class User extends Dream {
  public readonly get table() {
    return 'users' as const
  }

  public id: number
  public content: string | null

  @HasOne(() => Post)
  public post: Post
}
```
