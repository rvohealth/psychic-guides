# has many

Similar to has one, but returning an array of records, rather than a single record (which makes much more sense in the case of `User` and `Post` models). Like the Has one relationship, it assumes the foreign key to be on opposite model.

```ts
export default class User extends Dream {
  public readonly get table() {
    return 'users' as const
  }

  public id: number
  public content: string | null

  @HasMany(() => Post)
  public posts: Post[]
}
```
