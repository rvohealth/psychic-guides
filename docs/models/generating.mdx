# generating

The psy cli provides three commands for generating Dream models and their accompanying migrations and serializers:

```sh
yarn psy g:model  --help
yarn psy g:sti-child  --help
yarn psy g:resource  --help
```

The resource generator is used when a model will be displayed and/or manipulated via an API endpoint. The model generator is used to generate a model without an API endpoint. And, as the name indicates, the STI child generator is used to generate STI children.

Resource generator commands can be found in the [resource generator documentation](/docs/controllers/generating#resources), and the [sti-child has its own, dedicated documentation](/docs/cli/generators/sti-child), but here are some examples of the model and sti-child generator:

```sh
yarn psy g:model --no-serializer User email:citext first_name:citext last_name:citext

yarn psy g:model Guest User:belongs_to

yarn psy g:model --sti-base-serializer Room \
  type:enum:room_types:Bathroom,Bedroom,Kitchen,Den,LivingRoom \
  Place:belongs_to position:integer:optional deleted_at:datetime:optional

# use the --help flag to inspect all of the options
```

## snake_casing column, table, and enum names

Since sql is a case-insensitive language, it is encouraged that you write your columns and tables using snake case. Dream leverages a Kysely setting to automatically convert snake case to camel case so that your Typescript will use the conventional camel case while the database retains the database convention of snake case.
