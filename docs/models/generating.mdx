# generating

The easiest way to generate a model is by using the psychic cli.

```bash
yarn psy g:dream todo user:belongs_to content:string type:enum:todo_types:one_time,recurring
```

Psychic provides a rich api for composing models via generators, allowing you to get fairly specific with your architecture. when generating a dream, the general api is:

```bash
yarn psy g:dream NameOfDream col1:type col2:type ...
```

The following column types are supported out of the box:

```
bigint
bigserial
bit
bit varying
boolean
box
bytea
character
character varying
cidr
circle
date
double
inet
integer
interval
json
jsonb
line
lseg
macaddr
macaddr8
money
numeric
path
pg_lsn
pg_snapshot
point
polygon
real
smallint
smallserial
serial
text
time
time
timestamp
tsquery
tsvector
txid_snapshot
uuid
xml
```

We will allow whatever data types are supported by postgres. The complete list can be found here: [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

## special column types

In addition to the above column types, Dream also provides special column types for the common vernacular:

```
# string shorthand
name:string -> varchar(255)
name:string:200 -> varchar(200)

# datetime abstraction
created_at:datetime -> timestamp

# enums
species:enum:species_enum:cat,dog,bird,other
delicious_food:enum:delicious_food_items:chalupa,unknown
```

## snake_casing our columns

since sql is a case-insensitive language, it is encouraged that you write your columns and tables to snake case. We enforce this by providing a plugin under the hood through kysely which will forcibly convert all columns to snake case, and will translate the results back to camel case before handing them off to you. To further adhere to this principle, when you are naming columns in your generators, we encourage you to always give them snake_case names. Throughought the rest of your app, they will always be camelized, but it is preferred to keep them snake_cased in your migrations and generators.

## generating resources

If you know you will be needing endpoints exposed for the resource, you can additionally use the resource generator provided by psychic to also generate a controller. You will still need to add routes manually, and will definitely need to modify the generated code to tighten the wrenches authorization-wise, params-wise, etc...

```bash
yarn psy g:resource /api/v1/todos Todo user:belongs_to content:string type:enum:todo_types:one_time,recurring
```
