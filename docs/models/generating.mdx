# generating

The easiest way to generate a model is by using the psychic cli.

```bash
yarn psy g:dream todo user:belongs_to content:string type:enum:todo_types:one_time,recurring
```

If you know you will be needing endpoints exposed for the resource, you can additionally use the resource generator provided by psychic to also generate a controller. You will still need to add routes manually, and will definitely need to modify the generated code to tighten the wrenches authorization-wise, params-wise, etc...

```bash
yarn psy g:resource /api/v1/todos Todo user:belongs_to content:string type:enum:todo_types:one_time,recurring
```
