# generating

The psy cli provides three commands for generating Dream models and their accompanying migrations and serializers:

```sh
yarn psy g:model  --help
yarn psy g:sti-child  --help
yarn psy g:resource  --help
```

The resource generator is used when a model will be displayed and/or manipulated via an API endpoint. The model generator is used to generate a model without an API endpoint. And, as the name indicates, the STI child generator is used to generate STI children.

Resource generator commands can be found in the [resource generator documentation](/docs/controllers/generating#resources), and the [sti-child has its own, dedicated documentation](/docs/cli/generators/sti-child), but here are some examples of the model and sti-child generator:

```sh
yarn psy g:model --no-serializer User email:citext first_name:citext last_name:citext

yarn psy g:model Guest User:belongs_to

yarn psy g:model --sti-base-serializer Room \
  type:enum:room_types:Bathroom,Bedroom,Kitchen,Den,LivingRoom \
  Place:belongs_to position:integer:optional deleted_at:datetime:optional
```

Run `yarn psy g:model --help` or see [the g:model documentation](/docs/cli/generators/model) for details of the generator API.

## enum types

As demonstrated above, you can use the `enum` type as a column type when specifying your column, provided you give a little bit more information about the enum you are designing. Looking closer at the `type` field generated for the `Room` model in the above example, we see some extra information being provided:

```sh
type:enum:room_types:Bathroom,Bedroom,Kitchen,Den,LivingRoom
```

the `room_types` segment signals to Dream to create a new enum called `room_types_enum` within your db. The segment following the `room_types` segment informs Dream of what values you want to allow for your enum column. In this case, it will produce the following values for your enum:

```ts
;['Bathroom', 'Bedroom', 'Kitchen', 'Den', 'LivingRoom']
```

### enum arrays

In some cases, you may need an array of enum values for your column. In this case, simply provide `enum[]` as the column type segment, instead of `enum`, like so:

```sh
type:enum[]:room_types:Bathroom,Bedroom,Kitchen,Den,LivingRoom
```

Doing this will produce the same enum type in postgres, but the column definition will expect an array of enum values instead of a single value. Dream will also set the default value for an enum[] column to be a blank array.

## snake_casing column, table, and enum names

Since sql is a case-insensitive language, it is encouraged that you write your columns and tables using snake case. Dream leverages a Kysely setting to automatically convert snake case to camel case so that your Typescript will use the conventional camel case while the database retains the database convention of snake case.
