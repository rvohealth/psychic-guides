# paramSafeColumns / paramUnsafeColumns

`paramSafeColumns`/`paramUnsafeColumns` work in conjunction with `PsychicController#paramsFor` to limit what attributes will be set from params. This concept is similar to Rails' "strong params", but implemented at the model level and with different defaults.

By default, `PsychicController#paramsFor` will never include the following attributes (this cannot be overridden by `paramSafeColumms` or `paramUnsafeColumns`):

- the primary key (defaults to `id`)
- the created at field (defaults to `createdAt`)
- the updated at field (defaults to `updatedAt`)
- the deleted at field (defaults to `deletedAt`)
- the type field of an STI model
- foreign keys of BelongsTo associations
- the polymorphic type field of polymorphic BelongsTo associations

## paramSafeColumns

You can restrict the attributes that may be modified to _only_ the explicitly specified columns by creating a `paramSafeColumns` getter that returns the columns that may be safely updated:

```ts
class CoachingSession extends ApplicationModel {
  public get paramSafeColumns(): DreamColumnNames<CoachingSession>[] {
    return ['rated', 'meetingIntent', 'topic']
  }
}
```

Adding the default restricted column names to `paramSafeColumns` will have no effect.

## paramUnsafeColumns

Alternately, you can specify additional individual attributes (in addition to the defaults), that may _not_ be modified by adding a `paramSafeColumns` getter that returns the names of columns that may not be updated:

```ts
class Friend extends ApplicationModel {
  public get paramUnsafeColumns(): DreamColumnNames<Friend>[] {
    return ['bff']
  }
}
```
