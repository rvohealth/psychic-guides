# last

The last method returns the last record found in the given table.

```ts
const user = await User.last()
// User{id=9000}
```

:::tip
In some cases, [lastOrFail](/docs/models/querying/lastOrFail) may be more ideal, since it will raise a `RecordNotFound` exception, causing the request to fail with a 404 error automatically.
