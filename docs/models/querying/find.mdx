# find

Find is a simple static method used to find records by its model's primary key. It will either return the record if found, or else null

```ts
const user = await User.find(123)
```

:::tip
In some cases, [findOrFail](/docs/models/querying/findOrFail) may be more ideal, since it will raise a `RecordNotFound` exception, causing the request to fail with a 404 error automatically.
