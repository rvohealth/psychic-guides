# find

Find is a simple static method used to find records by its model's primary key. It will either return the record if found, or else null

```ts
const user = await User.find(123)
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
where ("users"."id" = $1)
order by "users"."id" asc nulls first
limit 1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

## Chaining

Similar to other execution methods, `find` can be chained with other query building methods to filter at the sql level.

```ts
const user = await User.find(123)
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
where ("users"."id" = $1)
order by "users"."id" asc nulls first
limit 1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

:::tip
In some cases, [findOrFail](/docs/models/querying/findOrFail) may be more ideal, since it will raise a `RecordNotFound` exception, causing the request to fail with a 404 error automatically.
