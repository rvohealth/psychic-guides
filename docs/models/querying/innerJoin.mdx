# innerJoin

The `innerJoin` method enables you to join associations as part of your queries:

```ts
const hosts = await Host.innerJoin('places', 'rooms').all()
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "hosts".* from "hosts"
inner join "places" on "hosts"."id" = "places"."host_id"
inner join "rooms" on "places"."id" = "rooms"."place_id"
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

## Join conditions

You can also attach `and`, `andNot`, and `andAny` clauses to join statements. The second argument (the object) in the following code generates an `and` condition on the join:

```ts
const hosts = await Host.innerJoin('places', {
  and: { name: 'Mountain Cabin' },
}).all()
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "hosts".* from "hosts"
inner join "places" on "hosts"."id" = "places"."host_id" and "places"."name" = $1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

```ts
// An `and` statement on both `places` and `rooms`
const hosts = await Host.innerJoin(
  'places',
  { and: { style: 'cabin' } },
  'rooms',
  { and: { type: 'Bedroom' } }
).all()

// An `and` statement on just `rooms`
const hosts = await Host.innerJoin('places', 'rooms', {
  and: { type: 'Bedroom' },
}).all()
```
