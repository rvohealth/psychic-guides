# offset

The `offset` method enables you to offset the query by a certain number of records:

```ts
const users = await User.offset(30).all()
```

## Pagination

This is usually used in concert with `limit` to provide functional pagination:

```ts
const users = await User.limit(10).offset(30).all()
```
