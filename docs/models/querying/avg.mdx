# avg

The `avg` method returns the average (arithmetic mean) of a set of numeric values:

```ts
const avgOfAllScoresForAllGames = await Game.avg('score')
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select avg("score") from "games"
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

> NOTE: You _must_ pass a column that can be averaged, such as an integer or decimal. Averaging non-numeric columns will result in runtime exceptions.

## Chaining

You can leverage chainable methods to filter out records at the SQL level before calling `avg`:

```ts
const sportsballScoresAvg = await Game.where({ type: 'sportsball' }).avg('score')
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select avg("score") from "games" where ("games"."type" ilike $1)
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>
