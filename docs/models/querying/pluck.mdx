# pluck

The pluck method returns raw objects containing just the attributes specified. If only one attribute is passed, it is returned as a flattened array.

```ts
await User.pluck('id')
// ['123', '456']

await User.pluck('id', 'email')
// [['123', 'fred@flinstone.biz'], ['456', 'willlmmaaaaaaa@flinstone.biz']]
```

:::tip
If the query you are building could potentially return a very large amount of data, and you are unsure that you want to bring all that data into memory at once, try using [pluckEach](/docs/models/querying/pluckEach).
