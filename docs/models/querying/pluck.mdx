# pluck

The pluck method returns raw objects containing just the attributes specified. If only one attribute is passed, it is returned as a flattened array.

```ts
await User.pluck('id')
// ['123', '456']

await User.pluck('id', 'email')
// [['123', 'fred@flinstone.biz'], ['456', 'willlmmaaaaaaa@flinstone.biz']]
```

## Chaining

You can leverage chainable methods to filter out records at the sql level before calling pluck.

```ts
const id = await User.where({ email: ops.ilike('%burpcollaborator%') }).pluck(
  'id',
)
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users"."id" as "id" from "users" where "users"."email" ilike $1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

:::tip
If the query you are building could potentially return a very large amount of data, and you are unsure that you want to bring all that data into memory at once, try using [pluckEach](/docs/models/querying/pluckEach).
