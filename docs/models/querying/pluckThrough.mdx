# pluckThrough

The `pluckThrough` method enables you to drill through associations to get to the final columns to pluck.

```ts
await User.pluckThrough('pets', 'collars', ['id', 'color'])
// [['123', 'blue'], ['456', 'pink']]
```

:::tip
If the query you are building could potentially return a very large amount of data, and you are unsure that you want to bring all that data into memory at once, try using [pluckEachThrough](/docs/models/querying/pluckEachThrough).
