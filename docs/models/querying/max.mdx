# max

The `max` method will pluck a field with the highest value

```ts
const id = await User.where({ email: ops.ilike('%burpcollaborator%') }).max(
  'id'
)
```

:::tip
If you need to find the max value through an association, we recommend making use of the [maxThrough](/docs/models/querying/maxThrough) method, which was designed for this exact use case.
