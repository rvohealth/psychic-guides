# firstOrFail

The `firstOrFail` method returns the first record found in the given table. If no records exist, a `RecordNotFound` exception is raised:

```ts
const user = await User.firstOrFail()
// User{id=1}
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
order by "users"."id" asc nulls first
limit 1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

## Chaining

Similar to other execution methods, `firstOrFail` can be chained with other chainable query methods, such as `order`.

```ts
await User.order({ email: 'asc' }).firstOrFail()
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
order by "users"."email" asc nulls first
limit 1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

:::tip
If `firstOrFail` is called within a request cycle and the `RecordNotFound` exception is not handled manually, Psychic will automatically throw a 404.
