# firstOrFail

The `firstOrFail` method returns the first record found in the given table. If no records exist, a `RecordNotFound` exception is raised.

```ts
const user = await User.firstOrFail()
// User{id=1}
```

If firstOrFail is called within a request cycle and the `RecordNotFound` exception is not handled manually, Psychic will automatically throw a 404.
