ai_summary: "The count method returns a count of records in the table. Can be chained with where, limit, and other query building methods to count filtered results. Consider using exists instead for performance if you only need to check existence."

# count

The `count` method returns a count of the table:

```ts
await User.count() // 900
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select count("users"."id") as "tablecount" from "users"
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

## Chaining

If desired, one can first provide conditions prior to counting, enabling one to limit the scope of the query before applying count at the SQL layer:

```ts
await User.limit(10).count() // 10
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select count("users"."id") as "tablecount" from "users" limit $1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

Similar to other execution methods, `count` is compatible with all query building mechanisms. Below is a demonstration of utilizing several chained methods to capture a count:

```ts
await User.where({ active: true }).whereNot({ email: null }).count() // 5
```

:::info
Did you know that `count` can be pretty expensive to execute if you have a lot of data in your table? Consider using [`exists`](/docs/models/querying/exists) instead, if it can fit your use case.
