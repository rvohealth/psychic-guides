# count

The `count` method returns a count of the table

```ts
await User.count() // 900
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select count("users"."id") as "tablecount" from "users"
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

## Chaining

If desired, one can first provide conditions prior to counting, enabling one to limit the scope of the query before applying count at the sql layer.

```ts
await User.limit(10).count() // 10
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select count("users"."id") as "tablecount" from "users" limit $1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

Similar to other execution methods, `count` is compatible with all query building mechanisms. Below is a demonstration of utilizing several chained methods to capture a count:

```ts
await User.where({ active: true }).whereNot({ email: null }).count() // 5
```

:::info
Did you know that count can be pretty expensive to execute if you have a lot of data in your table? Consider using [exists](/docs/models/querying/exists) instead, if it can fit your use case.
