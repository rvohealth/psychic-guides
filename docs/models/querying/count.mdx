# count

The `count` method returns a count of the table

```ts
await User.count() // 900
```

If desired, one can first provide conditions prior to counting, enabling one to limit the scope of the query before applying count.

```ts
await User.limit(10).count() // 10
```

:::info
Did you know that count can be pretty expensive to execute if you have a lot of data in your table? Consider using [exists](/docs/models/querying/exists) instead, if it can fit your use case.
