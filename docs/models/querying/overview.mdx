# overview

You're probably tired of hearing it by now, but our querying paradigm was also modeled loosly after the Ruby on Rails querying patterns. We wanted to expose a querying interface which could tap into Kysely's type intelligence to expose beautiful autocomplete magic, but wanted to include the ability to use powerful rails-like features, such as joins and includes to enable the type intelligence to extend to associations against your models.

```ts
const users = await User.joins('posts')
  .where({
    posts: {
      content: ops.ilike('howyadoin'),
    },
  })
  .all()
```
