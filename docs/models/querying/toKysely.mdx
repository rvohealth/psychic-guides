# toKysely

The `toKysely` method returns the current query, converted to a Kysely query:

```ts
const selectQuery = User.where({ email: 'howyadoin' }).toKysely('select')
// SelectQueryBuilder{}
```

This is generally useful for debugging purposes, since it is often useful to tinker around in low level Kysely to compare to queries being executed in Dream.

Did you know that you can convert your Dream queries to SQL? See the [`sql` guide](/docs/models/querying/sql) for more info.
