# countThrough

The `countThrough` method returns a count of the table for a given association, enabling you to count associated records with ease:

```ts
await User.countThrough('posts') // 900
```

Similar to `preload`, `joins`, and others, a chain of association names can be passed, enabling you to count deeply nested associations:

```ts
await User.countThrough('posts', 'comments') // 12000
```

When chaining associations, where clauses can also be passed to limit the scope of the count, like so:

```ts
await User.countThrough(
  'posts',
  'comments',
  { rating: ops.greaterThan(3) }
)
// 80
```
