# min

The `min` method will pluck a field with the lowest value

```ts
const id = await User.where({ email: ops.ilike('%burpcollaborator%') }).min(
  'id'
)
```

:::tip
If you need to find the min value through an association, we recommend making use of the [minThrough](/docs/models/querying/minThrough) method, which was designed for this exact use case.
