# findOrFail

The `findOrFail` method, similar to `find`, will look up a record by its primary key. However, if that record is not found, a `RecordNotFound` exception will be raised, rather than returning `null`:

```ts
const user = await User.findOrFail(123)
// User{id: 123}
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
where ("users"."id" = $1)
order by "users"."id" asc nulls first
limit 1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

If `findOrFail` is called within a request cycle and the `RecordNotFound` exception is not handled manually, Psychic will automatically throw a 404.

## Chaining

Similar to other execution methods, `findOrFail` can be chained with other chainable query methods, such as `whereNot`.

```ts
await User.whereNot({ email: null }).findOrFail(123)
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
where ("users"."id" = $1 and not ("users"."email" is null))
order by "users"."id" asc nulls first
limit 1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>
