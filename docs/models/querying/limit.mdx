# limit

The limit method enables you to limit the number of results coming from your query.

```ts
const users = await User.limit(3).all()
```

Often, limit will be used in accordance with an explicit order statement, as well as an offset, to support pagination.

```ts
const paginatedUsers = await User
  .order('name')
  .limit(10)
  .offset(
    this.castParam('page', 'integer')
  )
  .all()
```
