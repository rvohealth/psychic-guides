# limit

The `limit` method enables you to limit the number of results coming from your query:

```ts
const users = await User.limit(3).all()
```

## Pagination

Often, `limit` will be used in accordance with an explicit `order` statement, as well as an `offset`, to support pagination:

```ts
const paginatedUsers = await User
  .order('name')
  .limit(10)
  .offset(
    this.castParam('page', 'integer')
  )
  .all()
```
