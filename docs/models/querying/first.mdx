# first

The `first` method returns the first record found in the given table:

```ts
const user = await User.first()
// User{id=1}
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
order by "users"."id" asc nulls first
limit $1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

## Chaining

Similar to other execution methods, `first` can be chained with other chainable query methods, such as `order`:

```ts
await User.order({ email: 'asc' }).first()
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
order by "users"."email" asc nulls first
limit 1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

:::tip
In some cases, [`firstOrFail`](/docs/models/querying/firstOrFail) may be more ideal, since it will raise a `RecordNotFound` exception, causing the request to fail with a 404 error automatically.
