# first

The first method returns the first record found in the given table.

```ts
const user = await User.first()
// User{id=1}
```

:::tip
In some cases, [firstOrFail](/docs/models/querying/firstOrFail) may be more ideal, since it will raise a `RecordNotFound` exception, causing the request to fail with a 404 error automatically.
