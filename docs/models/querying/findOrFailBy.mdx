# findOrFailBy

The `findOrFailBy` method enables you to pass custom attributes to locate a record by. If multiple records exist matching the conditions, only the first one found will be returned. If no record is found matching the conditions, a `RecordNotFound` exception is raised:

```ts
const user = await User.findOrFailBy({ email: 'abc' })
// User{email: 'abc'}
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
where ("users"."email" = $1 and "users"."deleted_at" is null)
order by "users"."id" asc nulls first
limit 1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

If `findOrFailBy` is called within a request cycle and the `RecordNotFound` exception is not handled manually, Psychic will automatically throw a 404.

## Chaining

Similar to other execution methods, `findOrFailBy` can be chained with other chainable query methods, such as `whereNot`.

```ts
await User.whereNot({ email: null }).findOrFailBy({ name: 'chalupa joe' })
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
where ("users"."name" = $1 and "users"."deleted_at" is null and not ("users"."email" is null))
order by "users"."id" asc nulls first
limit 1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>
