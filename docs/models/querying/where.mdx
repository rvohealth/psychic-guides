# where

The where statement will actually return back an instance of a Query (tethered by type generics back to the originating Dream class) which can then be chained with many statements before final execution.


```ts
await User.where({ email: null }).all()
// [User{ email: null }, User{ email: null }, ...]
```

Where statements will by default compare with strict equivilence. However, it is also possible to pass special expressions. The example below demonstrates the application of an `ilike` query being applied to your query.

```ts
await User.where({ email: ops.ilike('%burpcollaborator.net%') }).destroy()
// 3
```

> For more info on ops expressions, see the [ops guide](/docs/models/querying/ops).

If an array is passed as a value to a non-array field, the query will select any of the values provided in the array.

```ts
await User.where({ email: ['hi@hi', 'bye@bye'] }).all()
// [User{ email: 'hi@hi' }, User{ email: 'bye@bye' }]
```
