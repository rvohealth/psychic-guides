# sum

The `sum` method will sum a numeric column for all found records in the query:

```ts
const sumOfAllScoresForAllGames = await Game.sum('score')
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select sum("score") from "games"
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

> NOTE: You _must_ pass a column that can be summed, such as an integer or decimal. Summing non-numeric types will result in runtime exceptions.

## Chaining

You can leverage chainable methods to filter out records at the SQL level before calling `sum`:

```ts
const sportsballScoresSum = await Game.where({ type: 'sportsball' }).sum('score')
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select sum("score") from "games" where ("games"."type" ilike $1)
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>
