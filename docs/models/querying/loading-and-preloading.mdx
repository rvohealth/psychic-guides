# loading and preloading

When querying your database in sql, you will often be joining relational tables together using foreign keys to bind relationships to data entities. Dream provides associations as a way to abstract this away from you, enabling you to simply think in terms of the entities you are dealing with, not the underlying mechanisms required to join them together. This can turn a terrible amount of sql into a fairly trivial expression, like so:

```ts
const posts = await user
  .associationQuery('posts')
  .preload('comments')
  .whereAny([{ body: null }, { 'comments.body': null }])
  .all()

console.log(posts.flatMap((post) => post.comments))
```

By leveraging `associationQuery`, for example, we don't have to worry about manually applying a foreign key clause to target the correct userId on posts, that is done automatically for us by Dream. Additionally, by `preload`ing comments, we are ensuring that each post will have a `comments` property attached, pointing to a list of comments in the DB that have `null` bodies. Each of the loaded comments will only be loaded if the foreign key pointing to that post is present, and Dream will do this automatically without you needing to specify anything.

## preloading to serialize

Serializing, in short, is the act of representing your backend models to some kind of client. In most systems, there will be many different serializers in place all to represent a single model. For example, you might have a `PostSerializer`, and then an `AdminPostSerializer`. You may find that you need to sync these posts to an RSS feed, so you build another `RSSPostSerializer`. You may want to partition your serializers out based on if you are rendering them for an index endpoint, vs a show. In Dream, we will automatically encourage this pattern in our generators by auto-generating both a summary and detail variant for each serializer we generate. We encourage you to lean into this practice, withholding from rendering deeply-nested model chains onto your summary serializers, since this can force you to eager-load a mind-bending number of associations before hand to make it happen.

Since each serializer in your system will have different eager loading needs, you will need to determine the needs of your association chain, and make sure that all the eager loading requirements are met before serialization. Unlike many other ORMs and frameworks you may have previously used, Dream and Psychic do not permit any async calls within the serialization layer, since this can lead to famous N+1 chaos for the systems who don't work to discourage it. Additionally, any association in your serialization chain that you attempt to access without first eager loading will raise a hard exception in your system, alerting you to fix the probelm.

Considering all of this, it is very important to eager load all associations that are needed to properly render your serializer tree up front. For example, in the serializer tree below, we have several layers deep worth of associations that need to be rendered, and all of those associations will need to be loaded up front.

```ts
const UserSerializer = (user: User) =>
  DreamSerializer(User, user).rendersMany('posts')

const PostSerializer = (post: Post) =>
  DreamSerializer(Post, post)
    .rendersMany('comments')
    .rendersMany('likes')
    .rendersMany('similarPosts')

const CommentSerializer = (post: Post) =>
  DreamSerializer(Post, post).rendersMany('images').rendersMany('videos')

class User extends ApplicationModel {
  public get serializers() {
    return {
      // ...
      detail: UserSerializer,
    } as const
  }
}
```

To manually load all of these associations, you can take use one of our eager loading methods, like `preload`, `leftJoinPreload`, `load`, or `leftJoinLoad`, depending on the situation. Here is an example of us leveraging `preload` to eager load all of the associations specified.

```ts
  public async show() {
    const user = await User
      .preload('posts', 'comments', ['images', 'videos'])
      .preload('posts', ['likes', 'similarPosts'])
      .findOrFail(userId)
    this.ok(user)
  }
```

While this approach may be fine, it is brittle, since any changes to the serialization layer could cause the needs of this preload to change. It will require careful maintaining, and a robust spec layer that seeds association layers to their full depths before running them through endpoint tests, to make sure that serializers don't trip up on missing associations.

Additionally, you will need to keep an eye out and make sure to prune unneeded preload statements as your serialization needs shrink, to help keep your endpoints responding as quickly as possible. This can also be hard to do, so Dream offers a few tools to help make this a little bit better.

## preloadFor

Dream provides helpful bindings to the serialization layer, enabling developers to eager load all associations required for serialization up front, without needing to specify what they are. To tap into them, try using the `preloadFor`, which eager loads all associations required for serialization.

```ts
// without preloadFor:
const user = await User.preload('posts', 'comments', ['images', 'videos'])
  .preload('posts', ['likes', 'similarPosts'])
  .findOrFail(userId)

// with preloadFor:
const user = await User.preloadFor('detail').findOrFail(userId)
```

Both of these statements are technically equivilent at this moment, but the first one is not only cluttered with preload statements that you otherwise couldn't care less about seeing, it is also only narrowly satisfying your serialization requirements.

By using preloadFor, we manage to both clean up code, and ensure that we never have to refactor it, no matter how much the serialization chains shift beneath us over time.

## inspect:serialization

A CLI command can be run which will spell out the serialization needs of a provided model. This is useful if you are trying to get a quick window into the dense layer of nested associations you may be trying to render.

```sh
yarn psy inspect:serialization Post
```

A helpful printout will be displayed, indicating which serializers are requiring which, in a tree-like structure.

If you would like to specify a specific serializer key (other than the default), you can provide an optional second argument to the command, like so:

```sh
yarn psy inspect:serialization Post summary
```
