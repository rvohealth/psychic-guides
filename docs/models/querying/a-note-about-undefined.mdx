# a note about undefined

tl;dr: Dream will throw `CannotPassUndefinedAsAValueToAWhereClause` at runtime if a key used in a `where` clause is set to `undefined`.

`undefined` poses a special challenge to a Typescript querying API since, to Typescript, setting an object key to `undefined` is identical to omitting that key. For example:

```ts
const { authSystemId } = (await jwtVerify(jwt, jwks, keys))
  .payload as JwtPayload
const user = await User.findBy({ authSystemId })
```

In this scenario, if the JWT didn't include an `authSystemId` key, then `authSystemId` would be `undefined`, and the `findBy` would devolve to simply selecting the first User. Obviously not what we want.

In addition to `findBy` and the `where` and `whereNot` methods, `where` clauses can also be passed to `associationQuery`, `destroyAssociation`, and the various methods that accept a chain of association names and where clauses (`preload`, `leftJoinPreload`, `pluckThrough`, `min/maxThrough`, etc.). So if `undefined` were allowed, there would be many ways that it could result in non-obvious, unintended behavior, making mistakes more difficult to spot and prevent. When we see a `where` clause with `someKey: someValue` in the code, we expect the SQL query to include a restriction on `someKey`!

To protect against potentially disastrous omission of where clauses, Dream `where` clauses, in all their forms, will throw `CannotPassUndefinedAsAValueToAWhereClause` at runtime when a provided key has `undefined` for its value. Runtime is sub-optimal, but since Typescript considers passing `undefined` to a key identical to omitting the key altogether, protecting at the typing layer is not possible.
