# sql

The sql method returns the sql that would be returned if executed.

```ts
console.log(User.where({ email: 'howyadoin' }).sql())
```

This is generally useful for debugging purposes, since it is often useful to see the executed SQL when you are executing queries.

Did you know that you can convert your dream queries to kysely queries? For those familiar with the underlying tooling in kysely, this can also be a useful debugging experience. See the [toKysely](/docs/models/querying/toKysely) guide for more info.
