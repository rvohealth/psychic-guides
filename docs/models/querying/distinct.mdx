# distinct

The `distinct` method returns all unique records matching the given distinct field:

```ts
const users = await User.distinct('name').all()
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select distinct on ("users"."name") "users".* from "users"
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

## Chaining

Similar to other execution methods, `distinct` is chainable to other query-building methods, such as `where`:

```ts
const count = await User.innerJoin('pets as p', { name: 'Aster' })
  .distinct('p.name')
  .count()
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select count(DISTINCT $1) as "tablecount" from "users"
inner join "pets" as "p" on "users"."id" = "p"."user_id"
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>
