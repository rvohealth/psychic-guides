# `Dream#load`: Loading Associations on Instances

The `Dream#load` method provides a way to load associations onto an already existing Dream model instance. This is particularly useful when you have an instance of a model and need to fetch its related data without re-querying the instance itself.

The call signature for `load` is very similar to [`preload`](./preload.mdx), and it leverages the same underlying mechanisms for fetching associated data.

## Basic Usage

You can call `load` on a model instance, specifying the association name. The method returns a _new instance_ of the model with the specified association(s) loaded. The original instance remains unchanged.

```typescript
// Assuming 'user' is an existing instance of a User model
// and User has a 'posts' association.

// If user.posts was not previously loaded, accessing it here would throw NonLoadedAssociation.
// const user = await User.firstOrFail();

const userWithPosts = await user.load('posts').execute()

// userWithPosts is a new User instance.
// userWithPosts.posts is now populated.
// The original 'user' instance's 'posts' association remains unloaded.

console.log(userWithPosts.posts) // [Post{}, Post{}, ...]
```

This is useful if you have an instance and decide you need more data for it.

## Chaining `load` Calls

You can chain multiple `load` calls to load several associations at once, or even nested associations:

```typescript
let user = await User.firstOrFail() // Fetches a user without posts or pets

// Load 'posts' (where body is null) and 'pets'
user = await user.load('posts', { body: null }).load('pets').execute()

console.log(user.posts) // [Post{ body: null }, Post{ body: null }, ...]
console.log(user.pets) // [Cat{}, Dog{}]

// Loading nested associations (e.g., posts and their comments)
// Assuming Post model has a 'comments' association
// And user already has 'posts' loaded from the previous step.
// To load comments for the already loaded posts:
user = await user.load('posts', 'comments').execute()
// user.posts[0].comments is now accessible on the new 'user' instance.
```

## `load` vs. `preload`

- **[`preload`](./preload.mdx)**: Used when initially fetching model(s) from the database. It loads the primary model(s) _and_ their specified associations in an optimized way (typically fewer queries). Use this when you know upfront what associated data you'll need.
- **`load`**: Used on an _existing model instance_ to fetch additional associations. It always returns a new instance of the model. Use this when you already have a model instance and subsequently realize you need more of its associations.

Both methods can take similar arguments for specifying which associations to load and any conditions for those associations.

## Checking if an Association is Loaded: `Dream#loaded()`

Before attempting to access an association, you might want to check if it has been loaded to avoid a `NonLoadedAssociation` error. The `Dream#loaded(associationName)` method can be used for this. It returns `true` if the association has been loaded (even if the result was, for example, an empty array or null), and `false` otherwise.

```typescript
const user = await User.find(1) // User instance without 'posts' loaded

if (user.loaded('posts')) {
  console.log(user.posts)
} else {
  console.log('Posts not loaded yet.')
  // You might choose to load them now:
  // const userWithPosts = await user.load('posts').execute();
  // console.log(userWithPosts.posts);
}

// Example from loaded.spec.ts:
const userWithPreload = await User.preload('mainComposition').find(user.id)
console.log(userWithPreload.loaded('mainComposition')) // true

const userWithoutPreload = await User.find(user.id)
console.log(userWithoutPreload.loaded('mainComposition')) // false
```

## Important Considerations

- **New Instance:** `load().execute()` always returns a _new_ instance of the model with the associations loaded. The original instance on which `load()` was called remains unchanged and will not have the newly loaded associations.

  ```typescript
  const freshUser = await User.create({
    email: 'charlie@peanuts.com',
    password: 'howyadoin',
  })
  const freshPet = await Pet.create({
    user: freshUser,
    species: 'dog',
    name: 'Snoopy',
  })

  const clone = await freshUser.load('pets').execute()
  // clone has the same attributes as freshUser but is a different object.
  // clone.pets is populated.
  // freshUser.pets would throw NonLoadedAssociation.
  ```

- **Transactions:** `load` can be used within a transaction by calling `txn(transaction)` on the instance first:

  ```typescript
  let petsOutput: Pet[] = []
  await ApplicationModel.transaction(async (txn) => {
    const user = await User.create(
      { email: 'fred@fred.com', password: 'password' },
      { txn },
    )
    await user
      .txn(txn)
      .createAssociation('pets', { species: 'dog', name: 'violet' })
    // Assuming 'user' might have other pets already, or this is the first.
    const userWithPets = await user.txn(txn).load('pets').execute()
    petsOutput = userWithPets.pets
  })

  console.log(petsOutput.map((p) => p.name)) // e.g., ['violet'] or ['existing_pet_name', 'violet']
  ```

- **Freshness:** Each call to `load().execute()` fetches the association data fresh from the database at that moment. If the underlying data changes between `load` calls, subsequent `load` calls will reflect those changes on the newly returned instance.

  ```typescript
  const user = await User.create({
    email: 'user@example.com',
    password: 'password',
  })
  await Pet.create({ user, species: 'cat', name: 'aster' })

  const clone1 = await user.load('pets').execute()
  console.log(clone1.pets[0].name) // 'aster'

  // Simulate an update to the pet's name in the database
  await Pet.query().where({ name: 'aster' }).update({ name: 'Snoopy' })

  const clone2 = await clone1.load('pets').execute() // Re-load pets
  console.log(clone2.pets[0].name) // 'Snoopy'
  // Note: clone1.pets[0].name would still be 'aster' as clone1 is unchanged.
  ```

By using `load` judiciously, you can manage data fetching for your model instances effectively, retrieving related data only when necessary. Remember to also consider [`preload`](./preload.mdx) for scenarios where associated data is needed at the time of initial model retrieval.
