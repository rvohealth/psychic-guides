# all

The all method returns all records matching the given conditions. If none are passed, it will return all records in the table.

```ts
await User.all()
// [User{}, User{}, ...]
```

Passing conditions to the query, we can drill down and limit the results returned.

```ts
await User.where({ id: [1, 2, 3] }).all()
[User{ id: 1 }, User{ id: 2 }, User{ id: 3 }]
```

:::warning
Though it can be tempting to reach for all, one must always consider the constraints of their own app when doing so. If your database has millions of columns in a table that you are querying, do you really want to bring all of that into memory at once? If the answer is no, then consider using [findEach](/docs/models/querying/findEach) instead.
