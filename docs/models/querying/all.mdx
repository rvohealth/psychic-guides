ai_summary: The all method returns all records matching the given conditions. If none are passed, returns all records in the table. Can be chained with where, order, limit, offset, and other query building methods. Warning: consider findEach for large tables to avoid loading all records into memory.

# all

The `all` method returns all records matching the given conditions. If none are passed, it will return all records in the table:

```ts
await User.all()
// [User{}, User{}, ...]
```

## Filtering with query methods

It can be tempting to reach for `all`, and then use plain TypeScript to further filter down your records, but if you have a very large users table, this approach can be very problematic for you. By leveraging our query building mechanisms, we can inject conditions into the query before executing. Below, we use the `where` method to inject a WHERE clause into our SQL, enabling us to filter down our records at the SQL level before bringing them into memory:

```ts
await User.where({ id: [1, 2, 3] }).all()
[User{ id: 1 }, User{ id: 2 }, User{ id: 3 }]
```

## Chaining multiple query methods

In addition to the `where` method, Dream supports several other query building mechanisms to make querying your database as simple as possible. Below, we will leverage several of these methods chained together to demonstrate the full power:

```ts
await User.order({ id: 'desc' })
  .limit(20)
  .offset(100)
  .where({ active: true })
  .whereNot({ email: null })
  .leftJoinPreload('pets as p')
  .whereNot({ 'p.name': null })
  .all()
```

:::warning
Though it can be tempting to reach for `all`, one must always consider the constraints of their own app when doing so. If your database has millions of columns in a table that you are querying, do you really want to bring all of that into memory at once? If the answer is no, then consider using [`findEach`](/docs/models/querying/findEach) instead.
