# whereAny

The `whereAny` method can be used to union two or more clauses together:

```ts
await User.whereAny([{ email: null }, { name: null }]).all()

// [User{ email: null, name: 'chalupa joe' }, User{ email: 'how@yadoin', name: null }, ...]
```

This enables you to permit two adjacent conditions, essentially achieving the SQL equivalent of an `OR` clause. This is useful if you want an either-or case to apply.

## Difference from where

:::tip
Perhaps you want multiple `where` clauses, but you don't want them to be either-or. In this case, you are generally just looking for a regular [where](/docs/models/querying/where) statement.
