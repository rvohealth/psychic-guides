ai_summary: The updateOrCreateBy method finds and updates a record, or creates it if not found. Functionally equivalent to upsert but runs in two queries (race condition risk). All lifecycle hooks run unless skipHooks is passed. Cannot be chained with query methods. Can be used with transactions.

# updateOrCreateBy

The `updateOrCreateBy` static method attempts to find and update a model with the given attributes. If no record is found, then a new record is created.

This is functionally equivalent to an upsert, except it is run in two database queries. Thus there is a risk of a race condition in the time between not finding a record and attempting to create one.

All lifecycle hooks are run for whichever action is taken, unless `skipHooks` is passed:


```ts
const user = await User.updateOrCreateBy(
  { email: 'test@example.com' },
  { with: { name: 'Alice' } }
)
// User{email: 'test@example.com', name: 'Alice'}
```

The `updateOrCreateBy` method cannot be chained with other chainable query methods.

## Skipping hooks

You can also choose to skip lifecycle hooks:

```ts
const user = await User.updateOrCreateBy(
  { email: 'test@example.com' },
  { with: { name: 'Alice' }, skipHooks: true }
)
// User{email: 'test@example.com', name: 'Alice'}
```

## Transactions

The `updateOrCreateBy` method can be used with transactions:

```ts
let user: User
await ApplicationModel.transaction(async txn => {
  user = await User.txn(txn).updateOrCreateBy(
    { email: 'test@example.com' },
    { with: { name: 'Alice' } }
  )
})
// User{email: 'test@example.com', name: 'Alice'}
```
