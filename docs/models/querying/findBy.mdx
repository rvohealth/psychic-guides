# findBy

The findBy method Allows you to pass custom attributes to locate a record by. If multiple records exist matching the conditions, only the first one found will be returned. If no record is found matching the conditions, null is returned.

```ts
const user = await User.findBy({ email: 'abc' })
// User{email: 'abc'}
```

:::tip
In some cases, [findOrFailBy](/docs/models/querying/findOrFailBy) may be more ideal, since it will raise a `RecordNotFound` exception, causing the request to fail with a 404 error automatically.
