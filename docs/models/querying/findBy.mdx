# findBy

The `findBy` method enables you to pass custom attributes to locate a record by. If multiple records exist matching the conditions, only the first one found will be returned. If no record is found matching the conditions, `null` is returned:

```ts
const user = await User.findBy({ email: 'abc' })
// User{email: 'abc'}
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
select "users".* from "users"
where "users"."email" = $1
order by "users"."id" asc nulls first
limit 1
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

:::tip
In some cases, [`findOrFailBy`](/docs/models/querying/findOrFailBy) may be more ideal, since it will raise a `RecordNotFound` exception, causing the request to fail with a 404 error automatically.
