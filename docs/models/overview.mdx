# overview

Since most web applications will require a database, Dream is the tool for abstracting the interaction with the database. Using conventional active record patterns, Dream leverages models to hold the individual values stored within the database, creating a powerful bridge between the types held in the database and the properties designated to the model.

```ts
export async function up(db: Kysely<any>): Promise<void> {
  await db.schema
    .createTable('users')
    .addColumn('id', 'bigserial', col => col.primaryKey())
    .addColumn('email', 'varchar(64)')
    .addColumn('created_at', 'timestamp', col => col.notNull())
    .addColumn('updated_at', 'timestamp', col => col.notNull())
    .execute()
}

class User extends ApplicationModel {
  public id: DreamColumn<User, 'id'> // string
  public email: DreamColumn<User, 'email'> // string | null
  public createdAt: DreamColumn<User, 'createdAt'> // DateTime
  public updatedAt: DreamColumn<User, 'updatedAt'> // DateTime
}
```

With migrations run, and the above model in place, you can begin leveraging some of the powerful methods built into Dream to simplify your interactions with the database.

```ts
const user = await User.create({ email: 'how@yadoin' })
user.email // 'how@yadoin'

await User.all()
// [User{ email: 'how@yadoin' }]
```

Dream provides a rich set of features for interacting with your database. We have only begun to get into it here, so we encourage you to explore the model guides to learn more.
