# single table inheritance

Single table inheritance allows one to have model inheritance supported at the database level by using a type field to capture the class name. Doing this automatically applies default scopes to the class ensuring that the type restriction is always applied.

Because Psychic provides model indexing for nested namespaces, we recommend you follow a Base model pattern, as shown below:

```ts
// models/Pet.ts
export default class Pet exteds Dream {
  @BelongsTo(() => User)
  public user: User
  public userId: number
}

// models/Pet/Cat.ts
@Sti(Pet)
export default class Cat extends Pet {
}

// models/Pet/NonCat.ts
@Sti(Pet)
export default class NonCat extends Pet {
}
...
```

On a corresponding model, you can define a has one or has many relationship with the STI models like so:

```ts
import Pet from './Pet'
import Cat from './Pet/Cat'
import NonCat from './Pet/NonCat'

class User extends Dream {
  ...
  @HasMany(() => [Cat, NonCat])
  public pets: Pet[]
}
```

Now you can easily load your models from the corresponding model like so:

```ts
const user = await User.first()
await user.load('pets')

user.pets
// [Cat{}, Cat{}, NonCat{}, etc...]
```
