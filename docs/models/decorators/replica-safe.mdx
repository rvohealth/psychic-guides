# ReplicaSafe

```ts
@ReplicaSafe()
export default class Lesson extends ApplicationModel {
```

If you have Dream models that are mostly read, seldom written, it can be advantageous to set up a read-only database replica. A model with the `@ReplicaSafe` decorator will send read queries (`find/findOrFail`, `findBy/FindOrFailBy`, `first/firstOrFail`, `all`, etc.) to the read-only replica. (Note: within a transaction, all queries are directed to the primary database.)

See [database config](/docs/config/dream#database-connection) to configure Dream with your read replica.
