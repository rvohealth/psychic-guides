# OpenAPI Overview

[OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.2.html) is a standard for representing API specifications. It is useful whether your service will be consumed by other services or front end clients such as mobile devices. Psychic and Dream work together to automatically generate [OpenAPI 3.0.2](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.2.html) specs for your web application with as little additional work from you as possible. They do this by leveraging:

1. the routes already defined in `api/src/conf/routes.ts`
1. the serializers you already use to turn models into JSON
1. an `@OpenAPI` decorator in controllers

The [resource generator](/docs/cli/generators/resource) automatically adds `@OpenAPI` decorator declarations corresponding to each endpoint, and since serializer attributes are typed back to the database schema, these types will stay in sync as you add migrations. (For example, if you add a migration to change a column from not allowing `null` to allowing `null`, the OpenAPI spec will change to include `nullable: true` for the corresponding property.)

Serializers and the `@OpenAPI` decorator also support hand-written specs to provide added flexibility when needed. As with everything in Dream and Psychic, these hand-written specs are strongly typed.

OpenAPI validation is enabled on all requests (when a request doesn't match, it returns 400) and on all responses when running specs (to ensure that any hand-written OpenAPI specifications match the data being returned).

To generate the OpenAPI spec, simply run:

<PackageManagerTabs
  code={`{{PM}} psy sync:openapi`}
/>

Psychic provides built-in support for generating OpenAPI schema to define your response payloads. Using the definitions you provide, Psychic will regenerate an `openapi.json` file at the root of your project whenever a sync occurs. Psychic will also use this to generate type files for your client app, facilitating easy synchronization of your API mechanisms to the current values provided by the backend.

## Automatic response generation

```ts
import { OpenAPI } from '@rvoh/psychic'
import Place from '../../../models/Place.js'
import V1HostBaseController from './BaseController.js'

const openApiTags = ['places']

export default class V1HostPlacesController extends V1HostBaseController {
  @OpenAPI(Place, {
    status: 200,
    tags: openApiTags,
    description: 'Fetch multiple Places',
    many: true,
    serializerKey: 'summary',
  })
  public async index() {
    const places = await this.currentHost.associationQuery('places').preloadFor('summary').all()
    this.ok(places)
  }
}
```

If the first argument to the `OpenAPI` decorator is a callback function, then the return value of that function will dictate the success response payload. In the above case, because the `many: true` flag has been passed, the openapi response will yield an array type for the response content:

```js
"paths": {
  "/places": {
    "parameters": [],
    "get": {
      "tags": [],
      "summary": "",
      "responses": {
        "200": {
          "content": {
            "application/json": {
              "schema": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                  "$ref": "#/components/schemas/PlaceSummary"
                }
              }
            }
          },
          "description": "index"
        }
      }
    }
  },
}
```

## Implicit serializer scanning

In the above example, a reference to the `#/components/schemas/PlaceSummary` component is made. This component is also generated in the components section of the openapi.json, leveraging the serializer attribute definitions to construct an image of the serializer when building component schemas.

```js
"components": {
  "schemas": {
    "PlaceSummary": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": [
        "id",
        "name",
      ],
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        },
      }
    },
  }
}
```

Dream supports OpenAPI notation within serializer definitions, allowing us to build openapi specs for each attribute:

```ts
import { DreamSerializer } from '@rvoh/dream'

const PlaceSerializer = (place: Place) =>
  DreamSerializer(Place, place)
    .attribute('id')
    .attribute('name')
    .customAttribute(
      'formattedDescription',
      () => ({
        label: 'Description',
        value: place.description,
      }),
      {
        openapi: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            label: { type: 'string' },
            value: { type: 'string', nullable: true },
          },
        },
      }
    )
```

## Extra response payloads

In addition to the default response shapes described, you can pass custom response objects to the `responses` field, enabling you to handle custom response codes.

```ts
export default class V1HostPlacesController extends V1HostBaseController {
  @OpenAPI(Place, {
    status: 200,
    tags: openApiTags,
    description: 'Fetch multiple Places',
    many: true,
    serializerKey: 'summary',
    responses: {
      400: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          errors: 'string[]',
        },
      },
    },
  })
  public async index() {
    const places = await this.currentHost.associationQuery('places').preloadFor('summary').all()
    this.ok(places)
  }
}
```

## Parameters

To populate the `parameters` field in your OpenAPI definition for this route, the `headers`, `body`, `pathParams`, and `query` options are passed:

```ts
export default class V1HostPlacesController extends V1HostBaseController {
  @OpenAPI(Place, {
    status: 201,
    tags: openApiTags,
    description: 'Create a Place',
    body: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        name: 'string',
        description: 'string',
      },
    },
    query: [{ name: 'search', required: false }],
    headers: [{ name: 'Authorization', required: true }],
    pathParams: [{ name: 'id', required: true }],
  })
  public async create() {
    let place = await this.currentHost.createAssociation('places', this.paramsFor(Place))
    if (place.isPersisted) place = await place.loadFor('default').execute()
    this.created(place)
  }
}
```

## Tags

When openapi routes are read, they are often grouped by the fields provided in their `tags` array. The `tags` option enables you to populate this field.

```ts
export default class V1HostPlacesController extends V1HostBaseController {
  @OpenAPI(Place, {
    status: 200,
    tags: openApiTags,
    description: 'Fetch multiple Places',
    many: true,
    serializerKey: 'summary',
    tags: ['places'],
  })
  public async index() {
    const places = await this.currentHost.associationQuery('places').preloadFor('summary').all()
    this.ok(places)
  }
}
```

## Detect Breaking Changes in Your OpenAPI Specs

When you update your code, your generated OpenAPI specs will often change too. To help catch **breaking changes** early, you can enable a built-in tool that compares your updated specs against the previous version (version in your head branch, probably `main`) and reports any issues.

To enable this feature, set the `checkDiffs` option to `true` in your [Psychic app configuration](https://psychicframework.com/docs/config/psychic). 

_Note: By default, this setting will **fail your builds** if breaking changes are found. This can be customized to your needs._

#### Example

```ts
// conf/app.ts
export default async (psy: PsychicApp) => {
  // Other config...

  psy.set('openapi', {
    // Other OpenAPI settings...
    checkDiffs: true,
  })
}
```
