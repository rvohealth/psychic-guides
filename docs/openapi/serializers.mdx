# OpenAPI - Serializers

Serializers have the unique ability to transform the attributes and associations assigned to them into robust OpenAPI types. Dream and Psychic both work together to leverage the products of the types provided by serializers into the openapi schemas produced. This enables you to compose openapi types with ease, and will automatically interpret database-level types into fully-expanded OpenAPI types without any effort on your part, allowing you to get all of the OpenAPI types for your app out of the box without doing anything (unless your serializers need to deliver something more than what is in the database).

## Automatic type inference

Serializers will automatically infer types provided to `Attribute`, `RendersOne`, and `RendersMany` decorators, as long as the correct arguments are provided. For the Attribute decorator, this is as simple as providing the parent model class as the first argument:

### Attribute type inference

```ts
class PetSerializer extends DreamSerializer {
  @Attribute(Pet)
  public name: DreamColumn<Pet>
}
```

Dream will automatically read the database types for `Pet#name`, returning an OpenAPI type like:

```ts
schema: {
  Pet: {
    type: 'object',
    required: ['name'],
    properties: {
      name: {
        { type: 'string', nullable: true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We recommend that you utilize type inference where possible, since it will automatically respond to migrations to generate the most up-to-date types, leaving you with a completely hands-off approach to maintaining your openapi types.

#### Date inference

Unlike most javascript-based frameworks, Psychic makes a careful distinction between DateTime and CalendarDate, which it uses for datetimes and dates, respectively. Psychic will automatically instantiate instances of `DateTime` and `CalendarDate` as it reads postgres `timestamp` or `date` fields from database rows and instantiates model instances out of them, and will automatically convert them to `iso8601` strings upon serializing to JSON, correctly delivering `YYYY-MM-DD` format for date fields, while delivering the full `iso8601` timestamp spec for date-time fields, including TZ information. In the OpenAPI layer, Psychic will automatically type dates and date-times respectively, like so:

```ts
class PetSerializer extends DreamSerializer {
  @Attribute(Pet)
  public createdOn: DreamColumn<Pet>

  @Attribute(Pet)
  public createdAt: DreamColumn<Pet>
}

schema: {
  Pet: {
    type: 'object',
    required: ['createdOn', 'createdAt'],
    properties: {
      createdOn: {
        { type: 'string', format: 'date' },
      },
      createdAt: {
        { type: 'string', format: 'date-time' },
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Associaiton type inference

With our `RendersOne` and `RendersMany` decorators, we provide nested serializer usage, without duplicating structures unnecessarily, like so:

```ts
class UserSerializer extends DreamSerializer {
  @RendersMany(Post)
  public posts: Post[]

  @RendersOne(Post, { optional: true })
  public latestPost: Post | null
}
```

which would produce something like:

```ts
schema: {
  User: {
    type: 'object',
    required: ['posts', 'latestPost'],
    properties: {
      posts: {
        type: 'array',
        items: {
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Post'
        }
      }
      latestPost: {
        anyOf: [
          {
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Post'
          },
          { null: true }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  Post: {
    type: 'object',
    required: ['id','body'],
    properties: {
      id: { type: 'string' },
      body: { type: 'string', nullable: true },
    }
  }
}
```

## Custom attribute definitions

If the inferred types will not work for your use case, then overrides can be provided directly to an `Attribute` statement, allowing you to specify custom OpenAPI types to fit your needs:

```ts
class Post extends DreamSerializer {
  @Attribute({
    type: 'object',
    required: ['en-US', 'en-ES']
    properties: {
      'en-US': 'hello world',
      'en-ES': 'hola mundo',
    }
  })
  public body: Record<LocalesEnum, string>

  @Attribute({
    type: 'string',
    nullable: true
  })
  public title: string | null
}
```

which would produce:

```ts
schema: {
  Post: {
    type: 'object',
    required: ['body', 'title'],
    properties: {
      body: {
        type: 'object',
        required: ['en-US', 'en-ES']
        properties: {
          'en-US': 'hello world',
          'en-ES': 'hola mundo',
        }
      },
      title: {
        type: 'string',
        nullable: true,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Psychic and dream are currently fixed to OpenAPI `3.1.0`, and plan to march forward with later versions. We attempt to support the full depth of their api (and if you notice anything that isn't, please open up an issue and we will correct it promptly!), which means you will be able to get typed support and autocomplete to aid you as you define your custom openapi definitions. This includes support for the following types:

- string
- number
- integer
- double
- boolean
- date
- date-time
- object
- array
- null

as well as conjuncting types, like:

- anyOf
- oneOf
- allOf

## Shorthand

Manually typing OpenAPI specs can be _pretty_ annoying after a while, so we have provided some helpful shorthand for those looking to save their wrists a little. For type primitives, rather than typing `{ type: 'string' }`, you can simply type `string`, like so:

```ts
class PetSerializer extends DreamSerializer {
  @Attribute('string')
  public name: string

  @Attribute('string[]')
  public nicknames: string[]
}
```

which would produce:

```ts
schema: {
  Pet {
    type: 'object',
    required: ['name'],
    properties: {
      name: {
        type: 'string',
      },
      nicknames: {
        type: 'array',
        items: {
          type: 'string',
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
