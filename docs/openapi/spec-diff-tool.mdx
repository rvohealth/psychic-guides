## OpenAPI Spec Diff Tool

This tool helps developers automatically detect **breaking** and **non-breaking** changes between the current OpenAPI specification(s) in your branch and the `HEAD` branch (e.g., `main`). It uses [`oasdiff`](https://github.com/Tufin/oasdiff) under the hood.

It’s designed to integrate easily into your existing workflows, either automatically or on-demand.

---

## Prerequisites

[`oasdiff`](https://github.com/Tufin/oasdiff) **must be installed** and available on your local system or CI environment.


```bash
brew tap oasdiff/homebrew-oasdiff
brew install oasdiff
```

or 

```bash
# Install oasdiff
go install github.com/Tufin/oasdiff@latest
```


_Your project must be configured using a `PsychicApp` where `checkDiffs: true` is enabled for any OpenAPI configuration you'd like to compare._

## Usage

Once `checkDiffs: true` is set in your OpenAPI config, there are two ways to run the diff tool:

### 1. **Automatic check**

<PackageManagerTabs
  code={`{{PM}} psy sync`}
/>

* Automatically runs OpenAPI diff checks for all configs that have `checkDiffs: true`.
* Recommended for use in CI pipelines or as part of your standard sync process.

### 2. **Manual check**

<PackageManagerTabs
  code={`{{PM}} psy diff:openapi`}
/>

* Manually triggers the diff comparison for enabled OpenAPI configs.
* Useful during development or pre-PR review.


## Fail on Breaking Changes

Use the `--fail-on-breaking`, or `-f` flag to **fail the command** if any breaking changes are detected:

<PackageManagerTabs
  code={`# when running sync
{{PM}} psy sync --fail-on-breaking

# when running directly
{{PM}} psy diff:openapi --fail-on-breaking`}
/>

* This will throw an error and exit the process if breaking changes are found compared to the `HEAD` branch (usually `main`).

## What It Compares

For each OpenAPI config:

* Fetches the OpenAPI spec from the `HEAD` branch (e.g., `main`)
* Compares it with the spec in your current working branch
* Uses `oasdiff` to generate:

  * A list of **breaking changes**
  * A **changelog** of all changes

## Output Summary

The CLI output will include:

* ✅ **No changes** — when files match
* 🚨 **Breaking changes** — highlighted in red
* 📋 **Changelog** — a detailed diff of modifications

### Example Output

```bash
🔍 Comparing current OpenAPI Specs against main...

✅ openapi: No changes

============================================================
📊 Summary: All OpenAPI files in current branch are identical to main branch
============================================================
```

Or, with breaking changes:

```bash
🔍 Comparing current OpenAPI Specs against main...

openapi: HAS CHANGES
   🚨 BREAKING CHANGES:
      • response removed on GET /users
   📋 CHANGELOG:
      • Removed response from GET /users

============================================================
🚨 CRITICAL: Breaking changes detected in current branch compared to main! Review before merging.
============================================================
```

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fail on breaking                            | Thrown if `--fail-on-breaking` is used and breaking changes are detected |
| File not found                              | Raised if OpenAPI file is missing in the current working directory       |
| Git error                                   | Raised if file cannot be fetched from `HEAD` branch                      |
