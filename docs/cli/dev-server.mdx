# dev server

The `dev` command starts a dev server for local development. This command is written directly to your `api/package.json` file (or your `package.json` file if your app is api-only), enabling you to customize it to your liking:

<PackageManagerTabs
  code={`# launch your psychic server
{{PM}} dev

# launch your psychic server AND your client app
CLIENT=1 {{PM}} dev`}
/>
