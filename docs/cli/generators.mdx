# generators

Psychic provides several generators for quickly building scaffolding for your app.

```ts
# generate migration
yarn psy g:migration create-users

# generate a model and migration
yarn psy g:model user email:string

# generate a controller
yarn psy g:controller users create update destroy

# generate a serializer
yarn psy g:serializer user email:string id:string

# generate a model, migration, controller, and serializer, and,
# provided your app is not api-only, a client api module
yarn psy g:resource api/v1/users user email:string
```
