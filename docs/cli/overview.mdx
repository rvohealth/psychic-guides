# overview

Psychic and Dream both provide a cli for interfacing with underlying bin scripts. These scripts are useful for doing things like database operations, syncing types, listing your routes, etc... To see the available list of commands, you can use the `--help` flag:

```bash
yarn psy --help

Usage: cli|generate:dream [options] [command] <name>

generate:model <name> [...attributes] create a new dream

Arguments:
  name                                                        name of the dream

Options:
  --tsnode                                                    runs the command using ts-node instead of node

  generate:resource|g:resource [options] <route> <modelName>  generate:resource <name> [...attributes] create a new dream, migration,
                                                              controller, and serializer

  sync:client [options]                                       sync api routes and schema to client application
  sync:client:routes [options]                                sync:client:routes generates a copy of the routes file that is consumable by
                                                              your client application.

  sync|sync:schema [options]                                  runs yarn dream sync
  routes [options]                                            examines your current models, building a type-map of the associations so that

                                                              synced to the dream repo for consumption within the underlying library.
  sync:routes [options]                                       reads the routes generated by your app and generates a cache file, which is then
                                                              used to give autocomplete support to the route helper, amoongst other things.

  db:create [options]                                         creates a new database, seeding from local .env or .env.test if NODE_ENV=test is

                                                              for env vars
  db:rollback [options]                                       rolls back your migrations, traveling back the number of steps specified

  console [options]                                           initiates a repl, loading the models from the development test-app into scope
                                                              for easy use
