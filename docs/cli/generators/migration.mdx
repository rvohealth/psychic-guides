# generating migrations

Use the built-in cli command for generating migrations to easily get up and running. Psychic will automatically timestamp the filename for your migrations, keeping them in sequential order, and will generate boilerplate to get you started with writing a migration.

```bash
yarn psy g:migration --help
yarn psy g:migration add-deleted-at-to-posts deleted_at:datetime
```

Ending the migration name with `-to-table-name` will automatically include the underscored table name in the migration.

If you want to also generate a model for this migration, you can simply use the [g:model](./model.mdx) or [g:resource](./resource.mdx) commands instead.
