# generate:resource

Psychic considers a resource to be something that is both a database model and an entity that is accessible via an endpoint. Not all of the models you generate may need to have api endpoints for accessing them, so you will not need resource generators for these, and can instead lean on the [model generators](/docs/models/generating).

See the [resource generator documentation](/docs/controllers/generating).
