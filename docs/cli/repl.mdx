# repl

The REPL (called `console`) enables you to inspect the database through the lense of your application. The code used to bootstrap your repl can be found in `conf/repl.ts`

```ts
# start local repl
yarn console
> u = await User.all()
```

By default, all of your models are loaded into the global namespace. However, to avoid class naming conflicts, all models will actually be namespaced based on their folder path, starting from the `models` directory. This means that if you have a model located at `Nutrition/LogEntry`, and another located at `Weight/LogEntry`, the class names in the repl will be `NutritionLogEntry` and `WeightLogEntry`, regardless of what their actual class names are.

If you want to add additional globals to your repl, you can do so by modifying the `conf/repl.ts` file, adding any additional globals to the provided `context`, like so:

```ts
// conf/repl.ts
import './global.js'

import * as repl from 'node:repl'
import { loadRepl } from '@rvoh/dream'
import initializePsychicApp from './system/initializePsychicApp.js'
import MyClass from '../services/MyClass'

const replServer = repl.start('> ')
export default (async function () {
  await initializePsychicApp()
  await loadRepl(replServer.context)

  // add your additional globals here:
  replServer.context.MyClass = MyClass
})()
```
