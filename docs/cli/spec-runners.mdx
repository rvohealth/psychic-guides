# spec runners

Spec runners enable you to run either unit or feature specs. These are written directly to your api/package.json file (or your package.json file if your app is api-only), enabling you to customize them to your liking.

<PackageManagerTabs
  code={`# run unit specs
{{PM}} uspec

# run feature specs
{{PM}} fspec`}
/>
