# spec runners

Spec runners enable you to run either unit or feature specs. These are written directly to your api/package.json file (or your package.json file if your app is api-only), allowing you to customize them to your liking.

```ts
# run unit specs
yarn uspec

# run feature specs
yarn fspec
```
