# spec runners

Spec runners enable you to run either unit or feature specs. These are written directly to your `api/package.json` file (or your `package.json` file if your app is api-only), enabling you to customize them to your liking:

<PackageManagerTabs
  code={`# run unit specs
{{PM}} uspec

# run feature specs
{{PM}} fspec`}
/>
