# sync

In order to provide type completion to both Kysely and Psychic, we must introspect your files to generate some types. Considering, there are a few more steps to getting set up than would be necessary in a conventional ORM. This is generally done for you (such as when you run migrations), but can also be done manually.

```bash
# syncs everything
yarn psy sync

# introspect database and generate schema
yarn psy sync:schema

# introspect your models and build an association index
yarn psy sync:associations

# syncs your api routes to your client folder
psy sync:client:routes

# syncs your serialization structure to the client app as a schema.ts file
psy sync:client:schema

# syncs both your api routes and your serialization schema to your client folder
psy sync:client
```
