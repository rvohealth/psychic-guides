# overview

In a standard MVC (Model, View, Controller) paradigm, a controller represents the entity which responds to an HTTP request. Controllers in Psychic are classes which inherit from the base `PsychicController` class, which can be imported from Psychic. They will inherit many useful methods for responding to requests, as well as many useful helpers for setting and reading cookies, accessing request parameters, and much more.
