# overview

Controllers house the event handlers for your web server. They directly connect to the routes established in your routes.ts file, to provide methods to respond to the provided route declarations. By default controllers, provide many powerful tools for establishing sensible, clean patterns to promote elegant software design patterns, as well as powerful generators for building new apps.

Since Psychic is using expressjs under the hood, the `req` and `res` properties will always be set on a controller instance, enabling you to utilize expressjs directly when needed, though the helpers provided by psychic directly should provide you all the tools you need for dealing with params.
