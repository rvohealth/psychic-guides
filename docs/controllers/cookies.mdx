# cookies

Since most modern applications will require some form of cookie usage, Psychic provides direct cookie support out of the box. Configuration for this can be set in `conf/app.ts`, both in the `cookie` config option (documented [here](/docs/config/psychic#cookie)), and in the `encryption` config option (documented [here](/docs/config/psychic#encryption)).

Psychic leverages symmetric encryption whenever creating or reading cookies on your behalf, utlizing the configuration you provide in `conf/app.ts`.

## Setting cookies

Since setting cookies is something that is request-driven, it can only be done within your controllers. Considering, helpful methods are attached to your controller to utilize your cookie configurations, like so:

```ts
// app/controllers/MyController.ts

  public async login() {
    ...
    this.setCookie('authToken', user.primaryKeyValue)
  }
```

Cookies attached using this process will automatically be `httpOnly`, and will inherit the configuration provided in your `conf/app.ts` file for expiration.

## Retrieving cookies

To retrieve cookies that have already been set, you can leverage the `getCookie` method provided on Psychic controllers, like so:

```ts
// app/controllers/AuthedController
  public async authenticate() {
    ...
    const authToken = this.getCookie('authToken')
  }
```
