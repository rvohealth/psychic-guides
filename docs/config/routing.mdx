# routing

In addition to configuration for building your express app, a separate configuration file is provided to configure the routing mechanism provided by psychic. This file is located at `conf/routes.ts`.

```ts
// conf/routes.ts
import { PsychicRouter } from "psychic"

export default (r: PsychicRouter) => {
  r.namespace("api", (r) => {
    r.get("ping", "users#ping") // points to the app/controllers/api/users.ts file’s ping method

    r.namespace("v1", (r) => {
      r.get("ping", "users#ping") // points to the app/controllers/api/v1/users.ts file’s ping method
    })
  })
}
```
