# routing

In addition to configuration for building your Express app, a separate configuration file is provided to configure the routing mechanism provided by Psychic. This file is located at `conf/routes.ts`:

```ts
// conf/routes.ts
import { PsychicRouter } from 'psychic'
export default (r: PsychicRouter) => {
  r.namespace('api', r => {
    r.namespace('v1', r => {
      r.namespace('host', r => {
        r.resources('places')
      })
    })
  })
}
```

<RoutesOutput>
  <pre style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
    {`
GET    api/v1/host/places      Api/V1/Host/Places#index
POST   api/v1/host/places      Api/V1/Host/Places#create
GET    api/v1/host/places/:id  Api/V1/Host/Places#show
PUT    api/v1/host/places/:id  Api/V1/Host/Places#update
PATCH  api/v1/host/places/:id  Api/V1/Host/Places#update
DELETE api/v1/host/places/:id  Api/V1/Host/Places#destroy
`}
  </pre>
</RoutesOutput>

The routes API is quite robust. For more information on available methods, see the [routing guides](/docs/routing/overview).
