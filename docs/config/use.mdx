## use

In addition to the [hooks](/docs/config/hooks) provided by psychic, you can tap into express middleware directly by leveraging the `use` method. This method acts similarly to the express `use` api for most use cases.

```ts
psy.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.json({ hello: 'world' })
})
```

If you need to inject at a specific point during the build cycle, you can provide an optional first argument, which will cause your middleware to run at the specified point:


```ts
// runs before any psychic middleware (i.e. cors) has been processed
psy.use('before-middleware', (req, res, next) => {
  res.json({ hello: 'world' })
})

// runs after all psychic middleware has been provided
psy.use('after-middleware', (req, res, next) => {
  res.json({ hello: 'world' })
})

// runs after all routes in the conf/routes.ts file have been processed
psy.use('after-routes', (req, res, next) => {
  res.json({ hello: 'world' })
})
```
