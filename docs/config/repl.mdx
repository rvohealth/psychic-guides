# repl

the `conf/repl.ts` file is used for bootstrapping the repl (which happens when you run the `yarn console` script).

```ts
// conf/repl.ts

import './loadEnv'
import * as repl from 'node:repl'
import { loadRepl } from '@rvoh/psychic'

const replServer = repl.start('> ')

export default (async function () {
  await loadRepl(replServer.context)
})()
```

By default, this config will automatically load all models and services to the global context (though beware, the names of the classes will shift in this context to be based around file path, rather than the name of the class itself), in addition to the DateTime class (provided by luxon).

If you need to bind anything else to the global context, you can simply attach it to `replServer.context`, like so:

```ts
import MyCustomClass from '../helpers/MyCustomClass'

export default (async function () {
  await loadRepl(replServer.context)
  replServer.context.MyCustomClass = MyCustomClass
})()
```

This will enable access once in the repl, like so:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development yarn console
> console.log(MyCustomClass)
```
