# websockets

2 configuration files are provided for configuring your websockets layer. the `conf/ws/start.ts` file will be run whenever your server starts up. Conversely, the `conf/ws/connect.ts` file will be run whenever a user connects via websocket to your system.

```ts
// conf/ws/start.ts

import { Server as SocketServer } from "socket.io"

// this is called once per each express boot

export default async (server: SocketServer) => {}
```
